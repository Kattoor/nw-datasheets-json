	<string key="0601_Watcher_Death_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"So people don't die here?"</string>
	<string key="0601_Watcher_Death_Response" speaker="Watcher Fayed - Windsward" name="WatcherFayed" VO="0601_Watcher_Death_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">Indeed, {playerName}. Sounds at first like one has arrived in paradise, does it not? It's the blue azoth - a power greater even than death.\n\nYou must still be wary, though. Some people die anyway, or worse.</string>
	<string key="0601_Watcher_Corruption_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Where does Corruption come from?"</string>
	<string key="0601_Watcher_Corruption_Response" speaker="Watcher Fayed - Windsward" name="WatcherFayed" VO="0601_Watcher_Corruption_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">A mystery for the ages, to be sure. Some claim to have the answer, but I remain skeptical.\n\nDoes Corruption arise from the darkness within one's soul, or does it have a will and purpose of its own?</string>
	<string key="0602_Magistrate_Windsward_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"You like living In Windsward?"</string>
	<string key="0602_Magistrate_Windsward_Response" speaker="Magistrate Korrapati - Windsward" name="MagistrateKorrapati" VO="0602_Magistrate_Windsward_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">Oh, I suppose so. Sometimes, one just knows when they're in the right place.\n\nPerhaps it's the weather, a certain opportunity, or even the people. In my case, it's all of the above. I belong here, if that makes sense.</string>
	<string key="0602_Magistrate_Factions_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Do I have to join a faction?"</string>
	<string key="0602_Magistrate_Factions_Response" speaker="Magistrate Korrapati - Windsward" name="MagistrateKorrapati" VO="0622_Magistrate_Faction_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">I can understand your hesitation. The factions can sometimes be a headache here.\n\nBut I cannot dispute the fact that they have become extremely influential, both here in Windsward and all over Aeternum.</string>
	<string key="0602_Magistrate_FactionsReady_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"I've talked to them. I'm ready to choose."</string>
	<string key="0622_Innkeep_WhereNow_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Where should I go now?"</string>
	<string key="0622_Innkeep_WhereNow_Response" speaker="Innkeep Suen" name="InnkeepSuen" VO="0622_Innkeep_WhereNow_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">I hear they've got bounties on the Lost up in Brightwood. With your skillset, you could probably do quite well.\n\nI've always wanted to go south, and visit Cutlass Keys as well.</string>
	<string key="0622_Innkeep_WhyHouse_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Why should I buy a house?"</string>
	<string key="0622_Innkeep_WhyHouse_Response" speaker="Innkeep Suen" name="InnkeepSuen" VO="0622_Innkeep_WhyHouse_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">I'm happy here at the inn, but that's because it's cheap. If I could afford it, I'd buy a house.\n\nI'd furnish the place to my liking, and it would be nice to have a personal space to return to whenever I like.</string>
	<string key="0603_Survivalist_01_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Why set up camp outside town?"</string>
	<string key="0603_Survivalist_01_Response" speaker="Survivalist Karsattin" name="SurvivalistKarsattin" gender="Female" VO="0603_Survivalist_01_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">Why, there are many reasons. For starters, it's a place where you can rest and you can craft supplies.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, if you get yourself killed, it's a convenient place to be resurrected.</string>
	<string key="0602_Marauder_talk_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Tell me about the Marauders."</string>
	<string key="0602_Marauder_talk_Response" speaker="Commander Joshi" name="CommanderJoshi" VO="0602_Marauder_talk_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">We are the strongest of the strong. Where others hesitate, we charge headfirst into the fray.\n\nA Marauder is rewarded not only in gold, but in the glory of each victory.</string>
	<string key="0602_Syndicate_talk_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Tell me about the Syndicate."</string>
	<string key="0602_Syndicate_talk_Response" speaker="Alchemist Jansz" name="AlchemistJansz" VO="0602_Syndicate_talk_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">We are the only ones here who have the acuity to unravel the mysteries of this place. We will learn the secrets of azoth and its power, and usher in a new era of prosperity for all.</string>
	<string key="0602_Covenant_talk_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Tell me about the Covenant"</string>
	<string key="0602_Covenant_talk_Response" speaker="Adjudicator Dempster" name="AdjudicatorDempster" VO="0602_Covenant_talk_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">Aye, the Spark is what gives you life. It is the mover within ye. The purpose, the beliefs, that rise you from your bed every morn.\n\nThe Covenant are the stewards of the Spark, and of the poor souls who wander in darkness.</string>
	<string key="0602_Marauder_dye_talk_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Why did you give me this dye?"</string>
	<string key="0602_Marauder_dye_talk_Response" speaker="Commander Joshi" name="CommanderJoshi" VO="0602_Marauder_dye_talk_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">Are you proud to be a member of the Maruders?\n\nThen show it off - dye your armor in the colors of our banner.</string>
	<string key="0602_Syndicate_dye_talk_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Why did you give me this dye?"</string>
	<string key="0602_Syndicate_dye_talk_Response" speaker="Alchemist Jansz" name="AlchemistJansz" VO="0602_Syndicate_dye_talk_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">You can turn your armor purple to match the Syndicate banner.\n\nRemind people who you are.</string>
	<string key="0602_Covenant_dye_talk_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Why did you give me this dye?"</string>
	<string key="0602_Covenant_dye_talk_Response" speaker="Adjudicator Dempster" name="AdjudicatorDempster" VO="0602_Covenant_dye_talk_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">It's golden dye for your armor and clothes. It shows your faith and allegiance to the Spark.</string>
