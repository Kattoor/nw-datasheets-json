	<string key="0401_Watcher_Death_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"So people on Aeternum don't die?"</string>
	<string key="0401_Watcher_Death_Response" speaker="Watcher Reese" name="WatcherReese" VO="0401_Watcher_Death_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">Sometimes they do, but for the most part, you're right. Seems to be the blue azoth on the island, some kind of magic.\n\nBut it's not always perfect - sometimes people come back Corrupted or Lost. That can't be fun, can it?</string>
	<string key="0401_Watcher_Corruption_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Where does Corruption come from?"</string>
	<string key="0401_Watcher_Corruption_Response" speaker="Watcher Reese" name="WatcherReese" VO="0401_Watcher_Corruption_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">Ask five people, get five different answers. Some say it's a manifestation of the inherent evil in humankind.\n\nOthers seem to think it's some kind of brain disease. I just know it's bad news, and nothing to trifle with.</string>
	<string key="0402_Magistrate_Everfall_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Do you like living In Everfall?"</string>
	<string key="0402_Magistrate_Everfall_Response" speaker="Magistrate Clark" name="MagistrateClark" VO="0402_Magistrate_Everfall_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">I suppose so - good a place as any on this island. The food is good, the weather is tolerable.\n\nAnd we have the most colorful landscape of any territory I've been to... some of the most colorful personalities as well.</string>
	<string key="0402_Magistrate_FactionsReady_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"I've talked to them. I'm ready to choose."</string>
	<string key="0402_Magistrate_Factions_Response" speaker="Magistrate Clark" name="MagistrateClark" VO="0402_Magistrate_Factions_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">If you're called to service as a soldier, I think these outfits are the only option.\n\nThere have been other military orders in the past, and with luck, there will be more in the future. But for now, we have these three.</string>
	<string key="0404_Constable_EncroachingCorruption_prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"We should go and stamp it out."</string>
	<string key="0404_Constable_EncroachingCorruption" speaker="Constable Maecia" name="OverseerMaecia" VO="0404_Constable_EncroachingCorruption" VO_Status="Recorded">You'll have to be the one to do that. You don't want me out there, not these days.\n\nIndeed, go on and search the area around the settlement. Any sign of Corruption, you put an end to it.</string>
	<string key="0422_Innkeep_WhereNow_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Where should I go now?"</string>
	<string key="0422_Innkeep_WhereNow_Response" speaker="Innkeep Kamau" name="InnkeepKamau" VO="0422_Innkeep_WhereNow_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">That's an interesting question coming from you, and I suppose it depends on your tastes. \n\nThere's always Cutlass Keys for those who prefer the wild side, but then I'd suggest Brightwood if you're looking to make a difference.</string>
	<string key="0422_Innkeep_WhyHouse_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Why should I buy a house?"</string>
	<string key="0422_Innkeep_WhyHouse_Response" speaker="Innkeep Kamau" name="InnkeepKamau" VO="0422_Innkeep_WhyHouse_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">I personally love it here at the inn, but I live in a house.\n\nFor one thing, I've enjoyed furnishing the place according to my tastes. I also like the comfort of knowing if I get killed, I have a home in which to resurrect.</string>
	<string key="Survivalist0403_01_Prompt" comment="Topic - Camping UI prompt" speaker="Survivalist Lee" gender="M">"Why set up camp outside town?"</string>
	<string key="Survivalist0403_01_Response" comment="Topic - Camping text" speaker="Survivalist Lee" name="SurvivalistLee" gender="M" VO="Survivalist0403_01_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">Are you joking? It's a lot more convenient for one thing!\n\nYou need somewhere to hang your shirt while you run around the wild in just your pants. It's also a handy place to resurrect. Suit yourself, though!</string>
	<string key="0402_Marauder_talk_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Tell me about the Marauders"</string>
	<string key="0402_Marauder_talk_Response" speaker="Commander Hoang" name="CommanderHoang" VO="0402_Marauder_talk_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">The Marauders are a community of warriors who believe in self-improvement.\n\nIf we are blessed with eternal life, we should use it to sharpen our combat skills to perfection.</string>
	<string key="0402_Syndicate_talk_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Tell me about the Syndicate"</string>
	<string key="0402_Syndicate_talk_Response" speaker="Alchemist Olivera" name="AlchemistOlivera" VO="0402_Syndicate_talk_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">Let me put this way - in this world, there are those who thinkâ€¦ and those who do not.\n\nWe are the former, and we look down on the latter. We believe in facts and science.</string>
	<string key="0402_Covenant_talk_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Tell me about the Covenant"</string>
	<string key="0402_Covenant_talk_Response" speaker="Adjudicator Amano" name="AdjudicatorAmano" VO="0402_Covenant_talk_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">Without spirit, harmony, and brotherly love, what is life even worth?\n\nWhether in the old world or here in Aeternum, we fight for the Spark that unites all life across all time.</string>
	<string key="0402_Marauder_dye_talk_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Why did you give me this dye?"</string>
	<string key="0402_Marauder_dye_talk_Response" speaker="Commander Chauhan" name="CommanderHoang" VO="0402_Marauder_dye_talk_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">So you can use it with pride, soldier. \n\nTint your armor in the color of the Marauders.</string>
	<string key="0402_Syndicate_dye_talk_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Why did you give me this dye?"</string>
	<string key="0402_Syndicate_dye_talk_Response" speaker="Alchemist Olivera" name="AlchemistOlivera" VO="0402_Syndicate_dye_talk_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">Use it if you want to, or don't. It matters not to me.\n\nSome Syndicate members want to show off their allegiance. It's just cosmetic, though.</string>
	<string key="0402_Covenant_dye_talk_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Why did you give me this dye?"</string>
	<string key="0402_Covenant_dye_talk_Response" speaker="Adjudicator Amano" name="AdjudicatorAmano" VO="0402_Covenant_dye_talk_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">It is a gift, so that you may color your robes to show your support of the Covenant.</string>
