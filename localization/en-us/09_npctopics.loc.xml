	<string key="0901_Watcher_Death_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"So people don't die here?"</string>
	<string key="0901_Watcher_Death_Response" speaker="Watcher Linch - First Light" name="WatcherLinch" VO="0901_Watcher_Topic_01_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">I know - right strange, isn't it? Something in the island - this, this blue azoth you see - that's what brings us back.\n\nIt doesn't always work though. Some people have died. Worse still, some come back Lost or Corrupted.</string>
	<string key="0901_Watcher_Corruption_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Where does Corruption come from?"</string>
	<string key="0901_Watcher_Corruption_Response" speaker="Watcher Linch - First Light" name="WatcherLinch" VO="0901_Watcher_Topic_02_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">Some people claim to have the answer, but I don't believe 'em.\n\nDoes it come from the dark part of a person's soul? From, from some vault of evil beneath the island? One thing I know for sure - it turns a man into a monster.</string>
	<string key="0902_Magistrate_FirstLight_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"You like living In First Light?"</string>
	<string key="0902_Magistrate_FirstLight_Response" speaker="Magistrate Bond" name="MagistrateBond" VO="0902_Magistrate_FirstLight_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">I'm surprised you feel the need to ask! Of course I do! This place has been my home for over a century!\n\nFirst Light used to be one of the most influential territories in all Aeternum. Not so much, these days.</string>
	<string key="0902_Magistrate_FactionsReady_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"I've talked to them. I'm ready to choose."</string>
	<string key="0902_Magistrate_FactionsReady_Response" speaker="Magistrate Bond" name="MagistrateBond" VO="0902_Magistrate_Factions_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">Sadly, in this day and age, I don't think you'll get far without aligning with one of them.\n\nYes, the factions can be quite infantile, but as I'm sure you've noticed, they're very influential around here.</string>
	<string key="0904_Constable_EncroachingCorruption_prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"That sounds urgent to me."</string>
	<string key="0904_Constable_EncroachingCorruption" speaker="Constable Oakes" name="OverseerOakes" VO="0904_Constable_EncroachingCorruption" VO_Status="Recorded">Indeed, you have handled matters with skill and discretion so far, so I would impose on you again.\n\nIf you will, scour the areas around the settlement and if you spot any Corruption, stamp it out right away. </string>
	<string key="0922_Innkeep_WhereNow_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Where should I go now?"</string>
	<string key="0922_Innkeep_WhereNow_Response" speaker="Innkeep Fairfax" name="InnkeepFairfax" VO="0922_Innkeep_WhereNow_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">I'm quite content here in First Light myself, but if you are the 'roving' type, I'd suggest Cutlass Keys.\n\nIt has kind of a wild, anything-goes atmosphere, if you like that sort of thing.</string>
	<string key="0922_Innkeep_WhyHouse_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Why should I buy a house?"</string>
	<string key="0922_Innkeep_WhyHouse_Response" speaker="Innkeep Fairfax" name="InnkeepFairfax" VO="0922_Innkeep_WhyHouse_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">You're welcome here in the inn, but many people find a house more desirable.\n\nYou can furnish the place, of course, and if you get yourself killed somehow, you can be resurrected right in the comfort of your own home!</string>
	<string key="0903_Survivalist_01_Prompt" comment="Topic - Camping UI prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Why set up camp outside town?"</string>
	<string key="0903_Survivalist_01_Response" comment="Topic - Camping text" speaker="Survivalist Riches" name="SurvivalistRiches" gender="Male" VO="0903_Survivalist_01_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">Why, there are many reasons. For starters, it's a place where you can rest and you can craft supplies.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, if you get yourself killed, it's a convenient place to be resurrected.</string>
	<string key="0902_Marauder_talk_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Are all Marauders like you?"</string>
	<string key="0902_Marauder_talk_Response" speaker="Commander Edwin" name="CommanderEdwin" VO="0902_Marauder_talk_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">Ay, we Marauders are a hardy bunch. We see this land here is ripe for the takin', and it's going to be us ending up on top.\n\nMight may not make right, but it sure is better than having your fate decided by others.</string>
	<string key="0902_Syndicate_talk_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"I guess the Syndicate is important to you."</string>
	<string key="0902_Syndicate_talk_Response" speaker="Alchemist Long" name="AlchemistLong" VO="0902_Syndicate_talk_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">The Syndicate offers only this -- the pursuit of truth. Raw, bracingly cold truth.\n\nIf you prefer the warm blanket of denial or the intoxicating elixir of conquest, choose another.</string>
	<string key="0902_Covenant_talk_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"What's all this talk about 'the Spark'?"</string>
	<string key="0902_Covenant_talk_Response" speaker="Adjudicator Jeffrey" name="AdjudicatorJeffery" VO="0902_Covenant_talk_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">We Covenant uphold the sacred duty to safeguard the Spark. This is the light that burns in the soul of every person.\n\nWithout belief, without purpose, the Spark extinguishes, and one becomes but an empty husk.</string>
	<string key="0902_Marauder_dye_talk_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Why did you give me this dye?"</string>
	<string key="0902_Marauder_dye_talk_Response" speaker="Commander Edwin" name="CommanderEdwin" VO="0902_Marauder_dye_talk_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">Well you don't drink it, you knave! You can use it to color your garb.</string>
	<string key="0902_Syndicate_dye_talk_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Why did you give me this dye?"</string>
	<string key="0902_Syndicate_dye_talk_Response" speaker="Alchemist Long" name="AlchemistLong" VO="0902_Syndicate_dye_talk_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">We give that to every new recruit. I guess you can use it to turn your boots purple.</string>
	<string key="0902_Covenant_dye_talk_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Why did you give me this dye?"</string>
	<string key="0902_Covenant_dye_talk_Response" speaker="Adjudicator Jeffrey" name="AdjudicatorJeffery" VO="0902_Covenant_dye_talk_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">Because the Covenant loves you, my friend. Use it to dye your attire our magnificent golden hue.</string>
