	<string key="0720_0102_HS_01_objective_desc" speaker="UI">I saw in the sky the beauty of the heavens, marveling at the sight of stars and the dance of lights. As I drew lines between the heavenly bodies, I split the heavens with my finger. I shared with my comrades the stories of these beings in the sky, as well as my own story. Such stories precede my birth, and will survive me for ages.</string>
	<string key="0720_0103_HS_02_objective_desc" speaker="UI">As I began my journey, I found first myself searching in the cays at the foot of the island. It took me to the top of a magnificent tower, and I pondered how our yearning for the sky drives the construction of these towers. To Holm, I entrusted my post, and visited the caverns south.</string>
	<string key="0720_0104_HS_03_objective_desc" speaker="UI">The stars above the caverns pointed me northeast. There, I found an isle that was closer to the Underworld than anything I ever seen. I descended into a realm where my soul was torn asunder by Hades himself. There, I fought his hellhound, and from that frothy maw stole a gem sky blue. I knew it was a sign.</string>
	<string key="0720_0105_HS_04_objective_desc" speaker="UI">As I trekked the Underworld, I found myself in its swamps. The chorus of voices crying out rang through the fog. I could sense the souls of those around me, and yet I could do naught but listen. Phantoms calling out in song, not unlike the Kokytos. I knew that I must transport this gem as a trial, and succeed where others have failed.</string>
	<string key="0720_0106_HS_05_objective_desc" speaker="UI">I waded through the swamps and, like a siren's song, I again found myself at another tower. I saw beings of the earth, the dryads, patrolling Eridanus that was entrusted to them. At its humble base, I shared the gem with these primordial protectors. They anointed it with a tear of azoth whose purity was unmatched. What a brilliant sight.</string>
	<string key="0720_0107_HS_06_objective_desc" speaker="UI">My journey was becoming clearer to me. To pierce the sky, the fates were bringing me to the many towers that dot the island. It brought me then to a tower in the valley of mourning. The tower stood like a solemn watcher. I met with the soldier at the top, and shared with him my story. To find a kindred soldier on this island is rare.</string>
	<string key="0720_0108_HS_07_objective_desc" speaker="UI">The final tower the fates brought me to was one ruled by the earth, and the dryads that protect it. In a land that birthed life here on this island, I climbed the tower searching for guidance. The guardians there tested my strength, and rewarded my spirit with a spearshaft made of an ancient, blessed wood.</string>
	<string key="0720_0109_HS_08_objective_desc" speaker="UI">My journey was coming to a close, my ultimate test was found the badlands choked by red: the Mangled Heights. I stood at the summit. I fastened sharp tendrils to the spearshaft, and affixed the skygem to purify my spear. I took my spear and leapt to the heavens, splitting them in pieces. Day shattered, giving its fractured lights to the Night sky, and I rested among the stars.</string>
