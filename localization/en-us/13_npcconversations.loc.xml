You see, the four of us always pick a meeting point in the event our hunts are unsuccessful. That none have arrived leads me to some… dark conclusions.</string>
	<string key="NPC_1331_MonsterHunter_DefaultDialogue_04" speaker="Evelyn Van Heck - Weaver's Fen" name="EvelynVanHeck" gender="Female" location="Weaver's Fen Wilds" VO_Status="Needs Recording">Well, this is grim, isn’t it? Am I the only one left?\n\nNo. Ruiz would not leave me like this. He must have…</string>
	<string key="NPC_1331_MonsterHunter_DefaultDialogue_05" speaker="Evelyn Van Heck - Weaver's Fen" name="EvelynVanHeck" gender="Female" location="Weaver's Fen Wilds" VO_Status="Needs Recording">I will remain vigilant. I cannot lose faith, nor hope, despite the fact that I must now hunt alone.</string>
	<string key="NPC_1332_Hunter_DefaultDialogue_00" speaker="Hunter Samuel Worthington Bloodgood III - Weaver's Fen" name="SamuelBloodgood" gender="Male" location="Weaver's Fen Wilds" VO_Status="Needs Recording">Greetings, denizen of this fine fetid land. Tis I! Samuel Worthington Bloodgood the Third, hunter extraordinaire, at your service!</string>
	<string key="NPC_1332_Hunter_DefaultDialogue_01" speaker="Hunter Samuel Worthington Bloodgood III - Weaver's Fen" name="SamuelBloodgood" gender="Male" location="Weaver's Fen Wilds" VO_Status="Needs Recording">You must be the hardy sort, to wander so freely in a place like this! I dare say you might even be capable with that weapon of yours.\n\nWhat say you to a friendly competition?</string>
	<string key="NPC_1332_Hunter_DefaultDialogue_02" speaker="Hunter Samuel Worthington Bloodgood III - Weaver's Fen" name="SamuelBloodgood" gender="Male" location="Weaver's Fen Wilds" VO_Status="Needs Recording">It would be terribly unfair of me to deprive you of another contest, since I so RUDELY abandoned my own attempt.\n\nShall we have another?</string>
	<string key="NPC_1332_Hunter_DefaultDialogue_03" speaker="Hunter Samuel Worthington Bloodgood III - Weaver's Fen" name="SamuelBloodgood" gender="Male" location="Weaver's Fen Wilds" VO_Status="Needs Recording">I am becoming increasingly eager to prove myself to you, my friend. To know you have toiled so in these blighted lands, and myself empty-handed! Why, it is hardly befitting of a Bloodgood, let alone the third.</string>
	<string key="NPC_1332_Hunter_DefaultDialogue_04" speaker="Hunter Samuel Worthington Bloodgood III - Weaver's Fen" name="SamuelBloodgood" gender="Male" location="Weaver's Fen Wilds" VO_Status="Needs Recording">I understand I am stretching the bounds of your credulity right now. Truly, I do.\n\nI have… a confession to make, if you will hear it.</string>
	<string key="NPC_1332_Hunter_DefaultDialogue_05" speaker="Hunter Samuel Worthington Bloodgood III - Weaver's Fen" name="SamuelBloodgood" gender="Male" location="Weaver's Fen Wilds" VO_Status="Needs Recording">I believe retirement is in my future. A quiet, obscure, shameless retirement where no one need witness my forebear’s disappointment.\n\nI should thank you, but I would rather we did not meet again.</string>
	<string key="NPC_1333_Architect_DefaultDialogue_00" speaker="Architect Na Li" name="ArchitectNaLi" gender="Female" location="Weaver's Fen Wilds" VO_Status="Needs Recording">Just look at this incredible stonework! Can't you just feel the weight of the years, pressing down?</string>
	<string key="NPC_1333_Architect_DefaultDialogue_01" speaker="Architect Na Li" name="ArchitectNaLi" gender="Female" location="Weaver's Fen Wilds" VO_Status="Needs Recording">Oh, hello! Perfect timing! I'm Na Li, the architect. You've probably seen my work in the Ebonscale settlement.\n\nSay, do me a favor. Take a look at this bridge, and tell me: how old do you think it is?</string>
	<string key="NPC_1333_Architect_DefaultDialogue_02" speaker="Architect Na Li" name="ArchitectNaLi" gender="Female" location="Weaver's Fen Wilds" VO_Status="Needs Recording">Well, this is puzzling. Judging by the level of erosion, sediment layers, and my chemical analysis… these stones could be several orders of magnitude older than I first guessed. It defies the imagination.</string>
	<string key="NPC_1333_Architect_DefaultDialogue_03" speaker="Architect Na Li" name="ArchitectNaLi" gender="Female" location="Weaver's Fen Wilds" VO_Status="Needs Recording">I will not allow myself to grow too excited just yet. But if my observations are correct, this stone is many hundreds of thousands, perhaps even MILLIONS of years old. Think of the implications!</string>
	<string key="NPC_1333_Architect_DefaultDialogue_04" speaker="Architect Na Li" name="ArchitectNaLi" gender="Female" location="Weaver's Fen Wilds" VO_Status="Needs Recording">The future is bright, and I am going to be the one to build it.</string>
	<string key="NPC_1334_Alchemist_DefaultDialogue_00" speaker="Tullius Volusus" name="TulliusVolusus" gender="Male" location="Weaver's Fen Wilds" VO_Status="Needs Recording">The stench of this swamp…it's so beautiful.</string>
	<string key="NPC_1334_Alchemist_DefaultDialogue_01" speaker="Tullius Volusus" name="TulliusVolusus" gender="Male" location="Weaver's Fen Wilds" VO_Status="Needs Recording">Stop for a moment, friend. Take a deep breath. Yes, drink it in. What does the Fen smell like to you?</string>
	<string key="NPC_1334_Alchemist_DefaultDialogue_02" speaker="Tullius Volusus" name="TulliusVolusus" gender="Male" location="Weaver's Fen Wilds" VO_Status="Needs Recording">You can close your eyes against sight, plug your ears against sound…but you can't escape the smell.</string>
	<string key="NPC_1335_Antiquarian_DefaultDialogue_00" speaker="Dr. Leonie Roggeveen" name="LeonieRoggeveen" gender="Female" location="Weaver's Fen Wilds" VO_Status="Needs Recording">If you happen to spot a woman hiding in some absurd corner of a ruin, do let her know she has won and the game is over. Thank you!</string>
	<string key="NPC_1335_Antiquarian_DefaultDialogue_01" speaker="Dr. Leonie Roggeveen" name="LeonieRoggeveen" gender="Female" location="Weaver's Fen Wilds" VO_Status="Needs Recording">Finally, a traveler along the road!\n\nI’m Dr. Leonie Roggeveen. My wife Nora and I – we work as a team – we’re here to see what we could dig up in these ruins. To study. We’re antiquarians– numismatists– scholars, you see.</string>
	<string key="NPC_1335_Antiquarian_DefaultDialogue_02" speaker="Dr. Leonie Roggeveen" name="LeonieRoggeveen" gender="Female" location="Weaver's Fen Wilds" VO_Status="Needs Recording">Hmm, that blue-ish hue means starmetal… and the three-faced queen on the obverse…there’s no doubt about it. This coin came from the Canopus dig site! \n\nBut wait! That’s strange…</string>
	<string key="NPC_1335_Antiquarian_DefaultDialogue_03" speaker="Dr. Leonie Roggeveen" name="LeonieRoggeveen" gender="Female" location="Weaver's Fen Wilds" VO_Status="Needs Recording">Ahem! Okay, let’s see what we’ve got here. Hmm… If I turn it this way and hold it against the other coin… Some sort of bridge? No… An aquedu-- Aha! n\nI’ve got it! It came from Aqua Acadia!</string>
	<string key="NPC_1335_Antiquarian_DefaultDialogue_04" speaker="Dr. Leonie Roggeveen" name="LeonieRoggeveen" gender="Female" location="Weaver's Fen Wilds" VO_Status="Needs Recording">Have you found any more clues? Or, uh, my wife?</string>
	<string key="NPC_1335_Antiquarian_DefaultDialogue_05" speaker="Dr. Leonie Roggeveen" name="LeonieRoggeveen" gender="Female" location="Weaver's Fen Wilds" VO_Status="Needs Recording">That was fun. In hindsight, the added threat of bodily harm did make it more thrilling. I am just glad she is back with me.</string>
	<string key="NPC_1336_AntiquarianSpouse_DefaultDialogue_00" speaker="Nora Roggeveen" name="NoraRoggeveen" gender="Female" location="Weaver's Fen Wilds" VO_Status="Needs Recording">Shh! Find your own hiding spot, will you?</string>
	<string key="NPC_1336_AntiquarianSpouse_DefaultDialogue_01" speaker="Nora Roggeveen" name="NoraRoggeveen" gender="Female" location="Weaver's Fen Wilds" VO_Status="Needs Recording">She must be so worried about me…</string>
	<string key="NPC_1336_AntiquarianSpouse_DefaultDialogue_02" speaker="Nora Roggeveen" name="NoraRoggeveen" gender="Female" location="Weaver's Fen Wilds" VO_Status="Needs Recording">I knew Leonie wouldn't be able to resist another puzzle. Be honest, she's loving this, right? She’s not too worried?</string>
	<string key="NPC_1336_AntiquarianSpouse_DefaultDialogue_03" speaker="Nora Roggeveen" name="NoraRoggeveen" gender="Female" location="Weaver's Fen Wilds" VO_Status="Needs Recording">I think our next game will feature less… excitement. Ah, well, lesson learned.</string>
