	<string key="1201_Watcher_Death_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"So people don't die here?"</string>
	<string key="1201_Watcher_Death_Response" speaker="Watcher Douglas" name="WatcherDouglas" VO="1201_Watcher_Death_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">Not most of the time, and most of us don't even age. It's something to do with the blue azoth.\n\nIt's just not always predictable - some age, some don't; some die, some don't; and then some come back as Corrupted or Lost.</string>
	<string key="1201_Watcher_Corruption_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Where does Corruption come from?"</string>
	<string key="1201_Watcher_Corruption_Response" speaker="Watcher Douglas" name="WatcherDouglas" VO="1201_Watcher_Corruption_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">Oh gosh, I'm not the person to ask. Some people think they have the answer, or so they say.\n\nMaybe the dark part of a person's soul... or maybe some evil disease that takes over the mind... I just know it's not pretty.</string>
	<string key="1202_Magistrate_Monarchs_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"You like living In Monarch's Bluffs?"</string>
	<string key="1202_Magistrate_Monarchs_Response" speaker="Magistrate Bixford" name="MagistrateBixford" VO="1202_Magistrate_Monarchs_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">I had a feeling you were going to ask that, inappropriate as it may be. \n\nI quite like it here. I used to live in Cutlass Keys, but I got the sense I wasn't wanted. People in Monarch's Bluffs accept me the way I am.</string>
	<string key="1202_Magistrate_Factions_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"I spoke to them. Do I make my choice now?"</string>
	<string key="1202_Magistrate_Factions_Response" speaker="Magistrate Bixford" name="MagistrateBixford" VO="1202_Magistrate_Factions_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">Oh, I think so. As rowdy and demanding as they can sometimes be, they are effective.\n\nIf you want to make a difference, here or anywhere in Aeternum, it's really the most efficient way to do so.</string>
	<string key="1204_Constable_EncroachingCorruption_prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"You wouldn't come to their aid?"</string>
	<string key="1204_Constable_EncroachingCorruption" speaker="Constable Saville" name="OverseerSaville" VO="1204_Constable_EncroachingCorruption" VO_Status="Recorded" dialogue-next="@1204_Constable_EncroachingCorruption_next">No. If the Corruption spreads to Everfall, that's their problem.\n\nWe have to fortify our defenses first, especially with these new reports of Corruption taking hold closer to the settlement.</string>
	<string key="1204_Constable_EncroachingCorruption_next_prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"How close?"</string>
	<string key="1204_Constable_EncroachingCorruption_next" speaker="Constable Saville" name="OverseerSaville" VO="1204_Constable_EncroachingCorruption_next" VO_Status="Recorded" dialogue-prompt="@1204_Constable_EncroachingCorruption_next_prompt">Close enough that we can't afford to ignore it. In fact, I'd like to entrust you with this responsibility.\n\nSearch the area near the settlement for any new Corruption emerging, and if you find any, destroy it.</string>
	<string key="1222_Innkeep_WhereNow_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"You think I should leave too?"</string>
	<string key="1222_Innkeep_WhereNow_Response" speaker="Innkeep Biton" name="InnkeepBiton" VO="1222_Innkeep_WhereNow_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">Well, that's entirely up to you. If I had your skills however, I'd try my luck in Cutlass Keys.\n\nThey say there's both azoth and gold there for anyone with the pluck to take it.</string>
	<string key="1222_Innkeep_WhyHouse_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Why should I buy a house?"</string>
	<string key="1222_Innkeep_WhyHouse_Response" speaker="Innkeep Biton" name="InnkeepBiton" VO="1222_Innkeep_WhyHouse_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">I mean, you're always welcome here in the inn, but a house offers some amenities.\n\nYou can furnish the place, of course, and if you get yourself killed somehow, you can be resurrected right in the comfort of your own home!</string>
	<string key="Survivalist1203_01_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Why set up camp outside town?"</string>
	<string key="Survivalist1203_01_Response" speaker="Survivalist Thorton" name="SurvivalistThorton" VO="Survivalist1203_01_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">Because it's better out there than in here, for one thing. It's also a place to rest and craft supplies.\n\nAnd then, if you do manage to get in over your head, get killed, it's a convenient place to be resurrected.</string>
	<string key="1202_Marauder_talk_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Tell me about the Marauders"</string>
	<string key="1202_Marauder_talk_Response" speaker="Commander Purcell" name="CommanderPurcell" VO="1202_Marauder_talk_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">We are the solution to a world in chaos. Through strength, discipline, and perserverence, we will enforce our will and bring this land to order.</string>
	<string key="1202_Syndicate_talk_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Tell me about the Syndicate"</string>
	<string key="1202_Syndicate_talk_Response" speaker="Alchemist Tuit" name="AlchemistTuit" VO="1202_Syndicate_talk_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">The Syndicate? Why, we are the learned ones. We use the razor of logic and the guide of reason to understand our world.\n\nWe possess forbidden knowledge. And we will wield the power of this knowledge, just as logic dictates.</string>
	<string key="1202_Covenant_talk_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Tell me about the Covenant"</string>
	<string key="1202_Covenant_talk_Response" speaker="Adjudicator Owgan" name="AdjudicatorOwgan" VO="1202_Covenant_talk_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">In all people, there is a Spark -- an initiative, if you will. In some people, it burns so brightly that others feel it.\n\nWe in the Covenant are the purveyors of the Spark. We foster its growth in all people. We protect the light.</string>
	<string key="1202_Marauder_dye_talk_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Why did you give me this dye?"</string>
	<string key="1202_Marauder_dye_talk_Response" speaker="Commander Purcell" name="CommanderPurcell" VO="1202_Marauder_dye_talk_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">You dye your armor with it, if you have time for that sort of thing.</string>
	<string key="1202_Syndicate_dye_talk_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Why did you give me this dye?"</string>
	<string key="1202_Syndicate_dye_talk_Response" speaker="Alchemist Tuit" name="AlchemistTuit" VO="1202_Syndicate_dye_talk_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">What dye? Oh, that Syndicate dye! Why you can use that to turn your boots purple.</string>
	<string key="1202_Covenant_dye_talk_Prompt" speaker="UI - player prompt">"Why did you give me this dye?"</string>
	<string key="1202_Covenant_dye_talk_Response" speaker="Adjudicator Owgan" name="AdjudicatorOwgan" VO="1202_Covenant_dye_talk_Response" VO_Status="Recorded">That dye symbolizes the hearts of all in the Covenant.  Use it to color your clothing, so all will know your affiliation.</string>
