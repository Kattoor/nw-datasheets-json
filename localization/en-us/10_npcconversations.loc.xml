I'm Claire, Claire Fergus. And I'm going to be a treasure hunter! I've read all about it! \n\nThat's why I'm in Cutlass Keys! This place is filled with pirate treasure, you just have to know how to find it.</string>
	<string key="1033_TreasureHunter_DefaultDialogue_01" comment="1033_0201_treasureisland" speaker="Claire Fergus - Cutlass Keys" name="ClaireFergus" gender="f" VO_Status="Needs Recording">Hello again! I have it on good authority that there is real pirate treasure nearby! I know it’s nearby, because I've got this map. Isn’t that exciting? \n\nYou know, I could use a partner to help me search, what do you say?</string>

I'm so mad! I can't believe Mister Broadbin cheated me out of my half of the treasure! Our half! \n\nI should have seen it. That old sailor didn’t just want to find pirate treasure, he wanted to be a pirate!</string>

You might have come across my old ship in your travels. \n\nAh, she was a fine thing in her day. Not too seaworthy anymore, though. We called her The Storm Petral.</string>

Though, it wasn't the only device I needed for my job. \n\nI had a wonderful mariner's astrolabe, the finest you ever did see. My grandad had used it, back when he sailed.</string>

Over twenty years of work went into those, before I ever reached the shores of this cursed island. \n\nAnd once I landed, well, I kept them around, to remind me of the past. Until they were stolen!</string>
	<string key="1034_Navigator_DefaultDialogue_04" comment="Final" speaker="Wistful Billiam Rowen - Cutlass Keys" name="BilliamRowen" gender="m" VO_Status="Needs Recording">I may not be sailing over the ocean anymore, but I can still chart the tides and stars like I used to. \n\nStrang thing, that. I'd swear this island moves about.</string>
