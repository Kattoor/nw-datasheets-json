	<string key="FTUE_Body_lore1a">The storm has become nigh unbearable. Gale winds, heavy bursts, roiling sea. The sleepless Captain insists we push ahead, his fixation on the vial of azoth onboard is too strong to combat. The substance is said to multiply the natural properties of all things, but the only thing I have seen it do is increase the Captain's possessive nature and secretive ways. He mutters to himself about a land of conflict, conquering, and endless azoth. None dare challenge him.\n“Mere Courage” Log 17\n</string>
	<string key="FTUE_Body_lore1b">At the Captain's request I have made a study of this strange vial he carries.\nWhat lies within is neither mineral nor liquid, defying all known properties of matter. It glows a haunting blue, and seems almost to hum when held by human hands.\nAll who make the perilous journey to Aeternum seek this azoth, but few understand it. I hope I am able to study the wellsprings of this substance said to be found on this strange island, and hope even more that I can send my research back to the Old World.\n\nAlmeda Umber\nScholar and Naturalist to the Capital Survey Expedition's “Mere Courage”\n</string>
	<string key="FTUE_Body_lore1c">I am two hours now wading amongst the wreckage. High water is coming and like to dislodge the ruins of the great ships grounded here. Some look ancient, while our galley appears to be the newest addition to this graveyard of expeditions. I cannot stay, but will forge inland to seek an overlook to make a signal and spy for other survivors.\n\nJoan Caron\nCartwright to the Capital Survey Expedition\nSurvivor of the wrecked ship “Mere Courage”\n</string>
	<string key="FTUE_Body_lore1d">I swear today I saw Almeda, speared through the chest with a timber, same as I witnessed him thrown overboard six days ago. There he was—pale, water-bloated, hissing, incoherent, and yet the same Almeda I shared mess with. I fled from his ghastly visage as he swiped at me with hands decaying. I do not know what shore we have encountered, but it is not the promised land of our dreams. Only purgatory, only a promise of unholy punishment.\n\nJoan Caron\nCartwright to the Capital Survey Expedition\nSurvivor of the wrecked ship “Mere Courage”\n</string>
	<string key="FTUE_Body_lore2">A foul, rotting thing bearing resemblance to our Captain struck at me from the ruins of a sloop. I drove a splintered oar through its neck, but not before it pierced my stomach with its rusted sword.\nCannot stop the bleeding. Shelter here. Must rest.\n\nJoan Caron\nCartwright to the Capital Survey Expedition\nSurvivor of the wrecked ship “Mere Courage”\n</string>
	<string key="FTUE_Body_lore3">Nothing dies</string>
	<string key="FTUE_Body_lore4a">I am beginning to understand why only a few vials of the potent azoth made it back to the Old World. It seems all who crash here are stranded with no hope of sailing out into the persistent storm surrounding the island. Even if I were to find a crew and repair a ship I doubt we would be able to get further than the horizon before being smashed to bits by a choppy and unforgiving sea. \n\nJoan Caron\nCartwright to the Capital Survey Expedition\nSurvivor of the wrecked ship “Mere Courage” \n\n</string>
	<string key="FTUE_Body_lore4b">There must be other survivors of the wrecks, though I cannot see them. I see the marks of their presence, footprints tinged with azoth in the sand leading my way forward. I follow these tracks and the strange blue flames that occupy the repurposed ship lanterns along the path. I pray I find some kind of refuge walking in the footsteps of those who came before me.\n\nJoan Caron\nCartwright to the Capital Survey Expedition\nSurvivor of the wrecked ship “Mere Courage” \n</string>
	<string key="FTUE_Body_lore4c">Awoke at camp, injury healed. I cannot judge how much time has passed but it was not the month of recovery that I needed for such a wound. I am restored, but… incomplete. I cannot return to the shore for fear of what I might find there—the carcass of my former self. This place will not let me die, as it has not released any sailor who drowned, only to wash upon these shores. The reaper claims no souls here, and the dead wander.\n\nJoan Caron\nCartwright to the Capital Survey Expedition\nSurvivor of the wrecked ship “Mere Courage” \n</string>
	<string key="FTUE_Body_lore4d">In the distance I have spotted two grand statues of fine craftsmanship standing against the waves. The tide has receded and there is nothing for me in the muddy grave behind me. Ahead, there is a bar of sand leading to the main land of Aeternum. I know not what I will find there, but it must be better than this.\n\nJoan Caron\nCartwright to the Capital Survey Expedition\nSurvivor of the wrecked ship “Mere Courage” \n</string>
	<string key="FTUE_Body_SealedCommission">We sail west-northwest with the breeze from the west increasing steadily. Cloudy, with unending rain. 2 knots, steady. We are about 600 miles under sail. Unseasonal dampness and warmth threatens to spoil provisions. Crew is haggard and morale is low with none in command sleeping nigh three days. Have the alchemists of the Old World sent us to our deaths chasing a fairytale?\n“Mere Courage” Log 13</string>
	<string key="FTUE_Subtitle_SealedCommission">Journey to Aeternum, Fragment 1</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Arch_AnUntouchedPiano">January 3. I find myself sitting at the piano more of late, yet my fingers do not touch the keys. Of all the items I salvaged from the wreckage, it has withstood time's erosion where all else in my life has not. In burying Genevieve and Simon, I felt as if I buried a part of myself – there is nothing to strive for, nothing more the island holds for me. Even the presence of the nearby outpost I find grating – the incessant traffic of merchant and animals back and forth on the roads, carving up and dividing what they can dig and pluck from the isle.\n\nThere must be more, something else I may focus upon. I fear that I will live here forever, aimless. I do not know why the isle did not awaken my wife, my son as it did so many others. Perhaps they had tired of life here. Tired of me, and saw no future in it.\n\nI may never know. But I know this – if I do not steady my racing thoughts, I may try to find the same path as they.\n\nR. Grenville</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Arch_Departure">January 17. I had a curious visitor a few days ago - a Frenchwoman M. Cartier, a tanner of buffalo - but more of the look of a hunter about her, oddly enough. She had heard of me and the piano, and sought me out to see it for herself. She seemed surprised by my disposition, but did not inquire deeply about it. I sensed she had lost someone, yet is at peace with it. Quite uncharacteristic of me, I asked her how she had come to cope.\n\nShe said that the isle itself awoke her. Some saw it as a hell, a curse, purgatory – some as a paradise, but that no one truly knew it at all. It was life, she said, and the isle gave birth to all manner of wonders to feed our curiosity. “We were not the first here,” she told me. “Others were here, you can see it in the ruins to the north, the Great Spheres upon the plains. This was a city once, all around us.”\n\nI inquired what happened to this city, and the people before us. She smiled and said, “M. Grenville, perhaps you were brought here to answer that question.”\n\nI gave her words much thought over the past few days. I will seek out these structures and what sense can be made of them – it is better than remaining here and letting more dust gather upon the piano keys.\n\nR. Grenville</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Arch_Rolfe">Feb 24. I have secured a guide, a fellow named Rolfe. Unlike the others, seemed undaunted by the tales of obelisks, spheres – even the dead amongst the ruins on the ridge. “They's dead, no life left in them,” he said. “Guarding nothing, Yorick's all.” He told me that you might chance across one of them in the underbrush while hunting, usually near the great stone structures of the isle, like the lighthouse to the south. I asked if he was not curious about them, and he shrugged – and said if I was, and I had coin or azoth to pay him with, then my curiosity was his gain. “Who cares who built them as long as they're naught more than skeletons now – dead and gone is how I prefer, and I'd rather not join them.”\n\nI told him my interest lay with the Spheres... and perhaps this curious temple he mentioned to the east.\n\nR. Grenville</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Arch_TheDigSite">April 1. Rolfe's guidance proved true. The man brought us to one of the Great Spheres, and said here we might labor without interruption. He also introduced me to a former quartermaster of the E. Stokes company, a stern woman by the name of “Maddie” (Madelaine), who leads a crew of a dozen laborers in need of employment (The Stokes Company came to an unfortunate end when their compound was torched by rivals). She seemed not bitter by the experience, only matter-of-fact, and had no wish to build more walls to be burned down.\n\nThe Sphere is partially buried as the others and requires men to dig, but Maddie assured us her crew would put their backs to it if they knew what was good for them – and I had the coin to pay them. I assured them I did. The lie tasted sour in my mouth, but I will figure out a means to pay them – the work on the Great Sphere must begin in the meantime.\n\nR. Grenville</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Arch_Excavation">April 15. The work goes swiftly. We have carried away the soil from beneath the Great Sphere, revealing the full mark carved upon the stone.\n\nMaddie's men labor honest and industrious – they work efficiently, which is well and good, as I am not certain how far my coin will last. Maddie is more worried about provisions - food has proven a challenge, as the scouts find they must range farther and farther from camp for game. This has worried Rolfe, though he has not said why. He is often at the perimeter, staring into the woods.\n\nMore curiously, Maddie claims she has seen such marks before, on smaller spheres being sold at the outposts. She said the small spheres were scavenged from hunters near the Temple to the East. Rolfe frowned at that and said it wasn't in the ground they found the spheres, but in the rib cages of skeletons there, like stone hearts. Maddie looked unsettled by the news, as did her men. I pressed Rolfe on this, but he refused to speak further. I must secure one of these spheres – after our work here, perhaps a trip to the Temple is in order.\n\nR. Grenville</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Arch_AnUnpleasantFind">April 17. One of the hunters returned, not with game, but with a strange talisman of bone, etched with red markings – the red might have been blood, but its hue was strange and reminded me of autumn colors in a way I could not explain – touching it something red and wet, yet I could see no stain upon my hand. The sensation lingered for quite some time after, like an unpleasant aftertaste in my thoughts.\n\nWhen the hunter showed it to Rolfe, Rolfe's temper flared – he cursed the man and told him to cast it away – “it'll draw others,” he spat –“the Withered wear them around their neck like collars,” he claimed.\n\nI had no reason to doubt him, and his reaction was such I scrubbed my hand where I had touched the talisman until it was almost bloody... yet I could still feel it on my skin.\n\nR. Grenville</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Arch_IllTidings">Grenville doesn't see it. I do. The Withered WILL be back for its fetish – we need to finish our work here and move on. Perhaps one we could handle, but when it comes, I do not think it will come alone – when they swarm, they're like locusts, consuming everything and everybody in their path.\n\nI feel they are watching us, but the why of it I don't know. Are they waiting to see what Grenville's efforts yield with the sphere? If so, that is a further cause for concern. If he unlocks their purpose - might they somehow make use of it? And to what end?\n\nRolfe</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Arch_AprilDig">...Grenville's like a horse with blinders, but an honest man and fair with the men - perhaps too fair at times. I don't know what he plans once we unearth this stubborn boulder, but the work is safer than spilling more blood for a drop of azoth.\n\nHis man, Rolfe, is a sharp but worrisome fellow, his brow seems to gain another furrow with each passing day. His eyes are always to the woods, and he jumps at every shadow and crack of a branch. Each day he presses Grenville for when we might move on. It is not robbers he fears, that much is certain.\n\nTimber and stone we have in plenty, it's game we need. And we'll need to see some coin from Grenville soon, or else the men's work will slow.\n\n-Maddie</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Arch_Misfortune">April 19. I write this far from the excavation, yet I am alive and must recount what happened. Rolfe and I were the only ones I know who managed to escape. It was near dusk, Rolfe had sought me out – one of the guides had gone missing – not deserted, of that Rolfe was certain – it was something else.\n\nHis instincts proved true, for as dusk bled out, we heard a distant cry in the woods, then silence – then spotted shapes, hunched, moved amongst the trees. Rolfe became afraid, but to the man's credit, it did not stay his actions, and he pushed me to move. “Where there's one, there's at least two others you can't see,” he hissed to me, and fighting my hesitation, I left the equipment behind.\n\nCursed isle – these infernal things seek to drive us from knowledge at every turn!\n\n-Grenville</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Arch_TheObelisks">Whatever powers these obelisks hold, the ancients of Aeternum made use of them – or more likely, shaped them themselves... but to what purpose, I do not know.\n\nLife grows thickly about them, striking blue flowers unlike any I have seen on the isle - and even azoth-infused flora, which we gather carefully.\n\nRolfe seemed out of sorts, has been since the attack on the dig site. He was hunched to the ground at a stone's throw from the obelisk, staring at it as if listening to something, clutching the vial of azoth I'd paid him with... I had to address him twice before the fellow snapped out of it, still at a loss for words.\n\nAfter addressing him rather sharply... perhaps sharper than was merited... Rolfe said he felt the azoth... ‘sing' in the presence of the obelisk, and did not know what to make of it.\n\nWe shall continue our circuit of the ring of obelisks, then leave the central Spire for last.\n\n-Grenville</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Arch_GrowingFears">May 20. Rolfe again voiced his fears the azoth might awaken that which lies dormant on Aeternum.\n\nThe man is a fool, and has not the heart to continue. I reminded him of the great fields of life that blossomed around the obelisks – if that was their power while the obelisks slept, what life might rise should they awake and how could that be naught but a good thing? Do we ourselves not awake each day and are better than when we sleep and know nothing but dreams?\n\nEven my reasoned arguments did not quell the man's doubt. He became quite animated, saying I knew not what might wake at the center Spire... even the dead, the skeletons that encircled the cursed temple might come alive, if their hearts were tied to this land.\n\nI suspect our ways must soon part, though I know his promise of payment keeps him in my shadow for now. If needs must, I will send him away, but before he goes, I will need his azoth for what I plan next. I will unlock the mysteries here, and cast such a light that it will burn away doubts and shadow from fearful minds.\n\n-Grenville</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Arch_TheSpire">I take no pride in what happened next but do not take this as a writ of confession. Rolfe refused me, and would not part with the azoth he carried. I explained to him, at length, that I was certain of my discovery but lacked the means to test it with the central obelisk, but with his cooperation, we might yet illuminate the secrets of the culture that had come before us.\n\nHe grew agitated and said that he would leave at dawn and head back to the Renee's home and seek shelter with the Frenchwoman – and take the azoth with him. He spoke of nameless dangers if I persisted in my efforts, until I grew quite tired of it, and told him I wished to hear no more.\n\nAt this point, I ordered him to part with the azoth one last time. He shook his head, and before he could give voice his refusal, I had sunk my knife into his throat. I knew it would not kill him, but I had no use for his body any longer – it was what he carried I needed. If he wanted to go, then so be it. His other belongings would remain should he brave the journey again. I took solely the azoth, and I made a promise that should our paths cross, I would repay him for its use – if Aeternum let him awake as it did for others.\n\nI have one attempt at this – and I shall do so at the central Spire.\n\n-Grenville</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Arch_TheGreatWork">[Page is partially burned] ...seems Rolfe spoke true – the azoth takes on a light in proximity to the obelisk, and I can see a tracery of light where none existed before. And the sound – like a roar, the closer one comes to the stone, as if something caged, waiting to be released.\n\nMy path seems clear... if these markings are touched with azoth, then perhaps the obelisk shall reveal its secrets and we will see what lies within. And should my findings prove...\n\n[page is burned, illegible]</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Arch_AzureFlames">[Page is burned, but it looks like it was written on after it was burnt, not before.]\n\nMy hands shake as I write this. I was a fool. First the Spire, the great light... the light grew above me like the dawn of a second day, and my heart lept with hope – and again, when I saw the torches along the main road blossom into blue flame. It was as if I'd awoken the isle itself!\n\nThen... then a terrible silence from the Spire as the light streaming from it froze in the air, as if paralyzed by touching the Earth. I confess... I was consumed by a growing dread, and I fled along the road, the blue flames leading my steps... as it turned out, here, to the Temple Ruins from before.\n\nThe Temple was no sanctuary. Had the azure flames summoned me here? Whatever occurred at the Spire, it had touched here as well, awakening something terrible. I saw the same blue fire that lit the lanterns of the road now burn within the chest of the skeletal figures I had taken for dead... they were not dead, I see now, merely sleeping. Now they walked, blades drawn, circling the Temple with dark intent. What have I awoken?\n\nMay the powers of Aeternum have mercy upon my soul.\n\n-Grenville</string>

Our doors are open to ALL pilgrims who seek the light that shines within the great ring of stones. In the aurora's light, cast aside fear, hold fast to faith. The Aurora Aeternae is fury, frozen - wrath, suspended – and it shields us all, for it is heaven's herald.\n\nYet like heaven's mysteries, let the light of the Aurora Aeternae ever remind us that not all secrets of Aeternum are for us to uncover, else one day the sun within the stone shall blossom with its full light and consume us all. To seek and never be content is Grenville's folly, the ‘scholar' who caused the blue flames of the road to be lit, the cursed dead of the eastern ruins to rise, and awoke this second sun in these lands – what knowledge did he gain when consumed by the aurora's light?</string>

	<string key="Lore_Body_Outpost_FortVelazquez">From Consolation do you come, then continue on in our graces.\n\nBefore you ask, yes, the legends of the red fountain are true – crimson Azoth awaits in the center of the isle, red with corruption, and we are content at Fort Velazquez to watch you leave in search of it as the Captain did when he abandoned his crew on Aeterna's shores.\n\nWe will give no warnings, no words of caution – the devils that hound us, Withered and Corrupted things all, are proof of where red-drenched temptations lead.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Outpost_MonarchStation">MONARCH BAY this may be, but in this fort be NO Kings, Queens, Lords, and other royal bastards - only those willing to WORK the land, and STAND with their fellow BROTHERS AND SISTERS.\n\nAZOTH does not come freely, but at least here, you STAND beside others who, like you, may NEVER see their homes again, and have committed to making AETERNA theirs – not for any lord, not for any King or Queen, but for the PROMISE of the future Azoth brings.\n\nP.S. If you pride yourself a Scholar – we have NO need of you. The words writ here are the most that shall be spent in these walls.\n\nP.S.S. If you bear the mark of the Red Sign – you are less than a Scholar and less than a dog. If seeking your “fortune,” seek it by drowning in the Corrupted of the Cleave, for that's the only fortune your greed deserves.</string>

	<string key="Lore_Subtitle_GettingStarted_StartingLocation">Safe Spawn Beaches</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_GettingStarted_StartingLocation">When you first enter Aeternum, you'll appear on one of a few beaches. These areas act as a &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="GettingStarted_Sanctuaries"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, where other players cannot attack you as long as you are not a &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Crime"&gt;Criminal&lt;/a&gt;.\n\nThese areas have a limited variety of resources to get you started, but won't get you very far without heading inland. Drowned Sailors raised by the Corruption of Aeternum roam these beaches, so it's best to move on quickly.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_GettingStarted_Outposts">Outposts</string>
	<string key="Lore_Subtitle_GettingStarted_Outposts">Neutral Hubs throughout Aeternum</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_GettingStarted_Outposts">Outpost are un-claimable neutral settlements that can be used by any player. They are spread throughout Aeternum with one or two in each major region.\n\nOutposts house a number of important benefits and stations, including:\n  • Outposts are the only place to access &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="TradingPost_Overview"&gt;Trading Posts&lt;/a&gt;\n  • Most outposts offer Sanctuary, where non-criminals cannot be attacked\n  • Every Outpost has an Inn, which can be activated as respawn location\n  • Outposts offer free storage for items personal to each character. Each outpost's storage is unique, meaning items stored at one outpost cannot be retrieved at a different outpost.\n  • Outposts offer a number of crafting stations for public use. Each contains a different selection of stations.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_GettingStarted_Coin">Earning Coin</string>
	<string key="Lore_Subtitle_GettingStarted_Coin">Economy and Trading Posts</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_GettingStarted_Coin">Coin is earned by killing enemies or by selling items at &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="TradingPost_Overview"&gt;Trading Posts&lt;/a&gt; located within each &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="GettingStarted_Outposts"&gt;Outpost&lt;/a&gt;. Once earned, your Coin is safe. You do not drop it when defeated in combat.\n\nThe simplest option to earn Coin is by defeating Corrupted or Angry Earth enemies. In addition to Coin, they also may drop Talismans and Animorum, which are dropped by various enemies throughout Aeternum. These items have no other use, but they can be dropped if you die. This makes it a good idea to sell them quickly. Talismans and Animorum are unique in that they can be sold directly to the &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="TradingPost_Overview"&gt;Trading Post&lt;/a&gt;.\n\nOther items can be posted for sale, but another player must buy them for you to earn any Coin. Players can &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="TradingPost_SellTab"&gt;post an item for sale&lt;/a&gt;, which leaves the item available for others to purchase at a price set by the seller. Additionally, players can &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="TradingPost_BuyTab"&gt;order an item&lt;/a&gt;, which offers to purchase a specific item for a price set by the buyer. You can sell instantly to these buy orders, or post an offer for your item in hopes that it will be purchased later.\n\nFor more info, the Systems Guide has a full chapter dedicated to the &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="TradingPost_Overview"&gt;Trading Post&lt;/a&gt;.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_GettingStarted_LevelingUp">Leveling Up</string>
	<string key="Lore_Subtitle_GettingStarted_LevelingUp">Character Progression in New World</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_GettingStarted_LevelingUp">When you level up, you'll be rewarded points you can spend on Attributes and Trade Skills. You can spend these points however you see fit. There are no classes in New World.\n\nYou can open the Progression screen at any time (default: [K]). There you can spend any points you've accrued to enhance your capabilities. Points are either Attribute points or Trade Skill points. They are not shared.\n\nAttributes are an expression of your character's overall capabilities as a person. They determine things like your total HP and Stamina, your defense against various types of damage, and whether or not you can wield certain weapons. You can hover your mouse over each attribute to learn about its affects, and you can experiment with your points to see their effects before committing to them.\n\nTrade Skills represent your ability to perform different actions. This includes harvesting, refining, and crafting items. You can see the specific effects of each level of a trade skill by mousing over the number for any given level.\n\nYou won't be able to unlock every point in every skill. You'll need to work with other players or use the &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="TradingPost_Overview"&gt;Trading Post&lt;/a&gt; to obtain high tier equipment.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_GettingStarted_Social">Friends and Company</string>
	<string key="Lore_Subtitle_GettingStarted_Social">Working with Other Players</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_GettingStarted_Social">There is strength in numbers, and cooperation is key to overcoming the greatest challenges Aeternum presents. There are a few key ways to work with others.\n\nFirst, you can create a Group with other players. You can use the &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_SocialMenu"&gt;Social Menu&lt;/a&gt; or Local Players list to invite other players to a Group. Doing this will help you to keep track of their location, health, and map marker. Groups are short term and can be left at any time. Up to 5 players can be in one. They're the best way to work with others when adventuring or heading into a battle.\n\nFor longer term cooperation, players can join each other's Company. You can use the &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_SocialMenu"&gt;Social Menu&lt;/a&gt; to invite others to your Company, which you created along with your character. Companies can have major impacts on Aeternum, including claiming Territories and declaring &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="GettingStarted_War"&gt;War&lt;/a&gt;. Members of Companies each have a rank, granting them various permissions like the ability to invite others, place structure blueprints, and withdraw items from the Company's storage. You can find information and controls for your Company in the Company screen (defaut: [G]).\n\nYou can also add players as a Friend so that you can see when they're online and make grouping with them easier in the future. By clicking their Player Portrait, you can click the Add Friend button to send a Friend Request. If they accept, they'll be listed in the Social Menu so you can see their status and do things like invite them to a Group or send them a Whisper without needing to search for them.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_GettingStarted_War">War</string>
	<string key="Lore_Subtitle_GettingStarted_War">Conquer and Defend Territories</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_GettingStarted_War">Companies throughout Aeternum can declare War on each other. During a War, the Companies involved can attack each other without the usual Criminal penalties. Wars take place over a set amount of time, and have a Pre-War phase to allow defenders to prepare.\n\nEach Company has the ability to set a Siege Window from the Company screen (default: [G]). While defending, the defending Company's Territory Protection can be ignored by attackers during this window. This means that their claim can be taken during this time, even if they've paid for protection. Companies should make sure that their Siege Window is set to a time that is easy for their members to participate, maximizing their chances of repelling attacks during this time of vulnerability.\n\nFor more detailed information about &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="War_Overview"&gt;Territories and War&lt;/a&gt;, there is a chapter of the Systems Guide dedicated to it.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_GettingStarted_Sanctuaries">Sanctuaries and Lawless Areas</string>
	<string key="Lore_Subtitle_GettingStarted_Sanctuaries">Places Where Crime Works Differently</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_GettingStarted_Sanctuaries">Some areas of Aeternum act as either a Sanctuary or a Lawless Area. These have largely opposite effects.\n\nIn a Sanctuary, non-criminals cannot be harmed by other players. &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Crime"&gt;Criminal Intent&lt;/a&gt; cannot be enabled in these areas. If you have time on your Criminal Timer, however, other players may still hurt you since Criminal Intent is not required to do so. This makes Sanctuaries a haven for players who have not committed any recent crimes, but incredibly dangerous for those who have. Most &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="GettingStarted_Outposts"&gt;Outposts&lt;/a&gt; are Sanctuaries, with a few exceptions.\n\nIn a Lawless Area, committing crimes does not increase your Criminal Timer. You still have to enable your &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Crime"&gt;Criminal Intent&lt;/a&gt; (default: [U]), but your Criminal Timer will not be increased regardless of what actions you take. These are areas where player vs. player combat is common, and anyone can turn on you in an instant without suffering the usual penalties. Lawless Areas are dangerous, but often offer some of the highest Tier resources. Some &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="GettingStarted_Outposts"&gt;Outposts&lt;/a&gt; are Lawless Areas. You can tell if an Outpost is Lawless from its icon on the Map.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Chapter_Mechanics">Mechanics and UI</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_Mechanics_Movement">Basic Movement and Interaction</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Mechanics_Movement">*Note: All controls are default, and can be changed in the Settings screen\n\nUse [W][A][S][D] to move around the world, and move the mouse to turn the camera.\n\nHold [SHIFT] to sprint. This costs Stamina while your weapon is drawn. If you have a lot of distance to travel, you can press [=] to toggle autorun. While autorunning, you sprint forward without needing to hold any other keys. Sprinting at a low ledge will cause your character to climb it.\n\nUse [TAB] to open your &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Inventory"&gt;Inventory&lt;/a&gt;. You can double click or drag items from your Inventory on the right to your Equipment on the left. Weapons and consumables are placed in a Quickslot. Armor and ammo are equipped in an apparel slot.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_Mechanics_Combat">Basic Combat</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Mechanics_Combat">*Note: All controls are default, and can be changed in the Settings screen\n\nWhen faced with an enemy, you can draw an equipped weapon by pressing its Quickslot number, [1], [2], or [3]. Alternatively, you can press [X] to redraw your last used weapon. Press the button again to sheathe the weapon.\n\nWith a melee weapon drawn, use [LMB] for a basic attack. Melee weapons also have a heavy attack ([F]) and a special attack ([Q]). Use the heavy attack if you can't break through an opponent's blocking. The special attack varies by weapon, so experiment with how to integrate it into your combat style.\n\nWith a ranged weapon drawn, hold [RMB] to aim the weapon and press [LMB] to shoot.\n\nTo avoid incoming damage, you can attempt to dodge by pressing a direction and [SPACE] at the same time. Or, while a melee weapon is equipped, you can attempt to block the attack by holding [RMB]. Both of these come at a large cost to Stamina, and must be used carefully to avoid becoming exhausted.\n\nStamina is a large part of combat. Most actions cost Stamina, and once you run out you enter an exhausted state. While exhausted, your basic attack becomes weak and slow, and you cannot roll or block. Be careful to monitor your Stamina so you aren't vulnerable at the wrong moment. Making sure you are well hydrated increases the rate that Stamina regenerates, so keep your Drink meter topped off to maximize your effectiveness.\n\nMagic and special attacks consume Mana. Mana is slow to regenerate, so be careful not to burn it too quickly.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_Mechanics_Vitals">Health, Stamina, and Mana</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Mechanics_Vitals">Health is an overall representation of your character's overall wellness. If you run out, you die. It regenerates over time as long as you keep your &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_FoodDrink"&gt;Food&lt;/a&gt; meter high enough. You can speed up this regeneration with magic, consumables, or by resting at your camp. Your maximum is determined by your Constitution attribute.\n\nStamina is used by most &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Combat"&gt;combat actions&lt;/a&gt;. Running out leaves you exhausted and vulnerable, so manage it carefully. It will regenerate over time, but having a low &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_FoodDrink"&gt;Drink&lt;/a&gt; meter will cause it to regenerate slower. Your maximum is determined by your Endurance attribute.\n\nMana is used for magic and special attacks. It regenerates slowly, and is not tied to Food or Drink. Resting at your camp speeds up its regeneration rate significantly, so if you're relying on Mana make sure to bring potions or take time between fights. Your maximum mana is based on your Intelligence and Faith attributes, and the regeneration rate is determined by your Focus attribute.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_Mechanics_FoodDrink">Food and Drink</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Mechanics_FoodDrink">Your Food meter is a representation of how well fed your character is. Eating food increases it, which in turn increases the rate you regain &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Vitals"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;. Running out won't kill you, but if it gets too low you won't heal over time at all anymore. It's important to keep this meter high in order to keep going after a fight.\n\nThe easiest sources of food are Berries found on bushes and simple Cooked Meat made at your camp from meat harvested from dead animals.\n\nSimilarly, your Drink meter is a representation of how well hydrated your character is. Drinking increases the meter, which improves the rate you regain &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Vitals"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt;. Even with an empty drink meter, your Stamina will still regenerate. However, having a high Drink meter will make sure Stamina refills quickly, and can be the difference in a tough battle.\n\nThe easiest way to refill Drink is simply from Fresh Water. Find a river or lake, collect some, and drink up.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_Mechanics_UI">Interface Navigation</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Mechanics_UI">*Note: All controls are default, and can be changed in the Settings screen\n\nThe most straight forward way to reach most aspects of the user interface is to press [ESC] to open the main nav bar. This shows a series of buttons across the top of your screen, social and group controls to the left, and enables interaction with other HUD elements like chat.\n\nThe Company screen ([G]) is where you can manage your Company and view the others in the game. This is where to go to manage Company members, set your Siege Window, control your Company treasury, and declare War.\n\nThe Map ([M]) shows the layout of Aeternum. You can zoom in and out by using the mouse wheel, pan by clicking and dragging, and place a waypoint with [RMB]. Mousing over an Outpost or Landmark will offer additional information and, in the case of Outposts, the ability to view your Outpost Storage there.\n\nThe Journal ([J]) is where you can manage your objectives (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED) and read collected Lore documents. You are looking at the Journal now.\n\nThe Progression screen ([K]) lets you view your character's attributes and trade skills, as well as the stats that are derived from them. It's also where you spend points to improve your character after leveling up.\n\nThe Settings screen contains a large number of options for display, audio, and controls. You can use it to change these things at any time.\n\nThe &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_SocialMenu"&gt;Social Menu&lt;/a&gt; allows you to search for other players. Once you've found one, you can hover over their Player Portrait to access a number of options. This includes sending a Friend Request, a Group or Company Invite, sending a Whisper, or blocking all of their communications in the future.\n\nThe Nearby Players list only appears if there is someone else nearby, and gives easy access to their Player Portrait. In a crowded area, it will only show 5 other players, so you may still need to use the normal Social Menu to access options for a specific player.\n\nChat appears to the left of the screen. Press [ENTER] to enable typing, and press [ENTER] again after inputting your message to send it. Chat can be in a number of channels, selectable by the dropdown next to the input box.\n\nEmotes are available by holding [P] and selecting an option with the mouse. Alternatively, if you know the emote's slash command you can type it into chat. Emotes are short animations your character can perform to express a simple emotion or sentiment, like cheering or beckoning someone over.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_Mechanics_Camping">Camping</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Mechanics_Camping">While exploring Aeternum, make sure to always place your Camp (default: [Y]). Your camp acts as a &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Respawn"&gt;respawn point&lt;/a&gt;, basic &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Crafting"&gt;crafting station&lt;/a&gt;, and rest area to replenish your &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Vitals"&gt;Health and Mana&lt;/a&gt;.\n\nYou can destroy your Camp by holding the same button used to place it. You do not need to be near it to do so. This lets you break camp from anywhere so you can place a new one without going back. Both placing and destroying your Camp are free, so do it often to make sure it's always nearby.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_Mechanics_Respawn">Death and Respawning</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Mechanics_Respawn">Dying in Aeternum is considerably less permanent than in the rest of the world, but it is not without consequence. When you die, you drop all items in your inventory on the spot, and your equipped items suffer a significant amount of durability loss. If you are a Criminal at the time of your death, you drop your equipment as well. Anyone can pick up the items you drop, but if you can get back to the location before anyone does then you can recover it all.\n\nWhen you die, you'll need to choose a location to respawn at. You can respawn at your placed &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Camping"&gt;Camp&lt;/a&gt;, at a nearby &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="GettingStarted_Outposts"&gt;Outpost&lt;/a&gt; if you've visited its Inn, at a house owned by your Company, or at a random &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="GettingStarted_StartingLocation"&gt;Starting Location&lt;/a&gt;. With the exception of the random Starting Location, each of these has a cooldown before you can use them a second time. If a respawn location is on cooldown, you cannot spawn there and must choose another option. Replacing your Camp does not reset its cooldown.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_Mechanics_SocialMenu">Social Menu</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Mechanics_SocialMenu">The Social Menu is how you access controls for other players. It contains a search bar, shows pending invitations, and lists your friends. You can search any player by name, even if they are offline.\n\nSending invites to players is done through their Player Portrait. Hovering your mouse over a Player Portrait opens a flyout menu with buttons to do things like invite the player to a Group, inviting them to your Company, sending them a Whisper (private chat message), adding them as a Friend, or Muting or Blocking their communications.\n\nAnywhere Player Portraits appear offer the same flyout. This includes chat messages, the Nearby Players list, and your Company Roster.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_Mechanics_Inventory">Inventory</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Mechanics_Inventory">Whenever you gather a resource or pick up an item it is added to your Inventory (default: [TAB]). These items are divided into 6 groups:\n  • Weapons, which can be wielded in combat.\n  • Apparel, which can be equipped to improve your stats or just dress up.\n  • Ammo, which must be equipped in order to use a ranged weapon. Arrows are for bows and cartridges are for firearms.\n  • Utilities, which can be used from your Inventory or equipped to a Quickslot. Most utilities are consumed when used. You can't eat the same meal twice.\n  • Tools, which are used to gather resources. Tools do not need to be equipped, just set as active. Your character will use the active tools automatically.\n  • Resources, which covers everything else. Mostly, these are items that are used to craft other items, but it also includes things like Talismans and Animorum.\n\nIn order to equip an item, you can double click it or click and drag it to the left. To drop it or place it into a storage container, hold [SHIFT] and click it or drag it to the middle of the screen. Equipped items are no longer in your Inventory, so don't forget where you put that potion.\n\nClicking an item will lock its tooltip open, and allow you to perform other actions like repairing, salvaging, or comparing it. The actions that are available vary by item.\n\nItems have weight. Items in your Inventory count against your Encumbrance. When you are carrying more than your Encumbrance limit, you will not be able to roll, run, or sprint. If you reach more than twice your Encumbrance limit, you will not be able to walk at all.\n\nSimilarly, items you have equipped count against your Equip Load. This includes any items in your Quickslots. As your Equip Load increases, you will move slower and dodging will cost more Stamina. If you exceed your maximum Equip Load, you will not be able to roll or sprint.\n\nYou can view the consequences of being Encumbered or Over-Equipped by hovering your mouse over the weight bar for each.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_Mechanics_Crafting">Basic Crafting</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Mechanics_Crafting">Every character can craft a number of simple items at their Camp. As you increase in level, you can invest in Trade Skills that allow you to craft other items and use other Crafting Stations.\n\nTo craft an item, first visit the Crafting Station. Your Camp acts as a Crafting Station for the Wilderness Survival skill, but there are several other types of Crafting Stations as well. Each crafting Trade Skill has a different station it uses. While you can view the recipes for other stations, you can only create items for the station you are at.\n\nFrom the Crafting Station, you can then choose the type of item you wish to make. Items you lack the resources for are in red, but you can still click them for more details.\n\nAfter selecting an item type, you'll need to choose what Tier of that item you want to make. Higher Tiers require rarer resources and higher skills.\n\nWithin the Tier, you can select the &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Crafting_Rarity"&gt;Rarity&lt;/a&gt; of each material you wish to use.\n\nFinally, press the Craft button to make your new item.\n\nFor more detailed information on Crafting, view the &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Crafting_Overview"&gt;Crafting&lt;/a&gt; chapter of this How to Play topic.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_Mechanics_Crime">Crime and Open World PvP</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Mechanics_Crime">Aeternum is a dangerous place, and many take to banditry and murder. Any player may attack another player at any time, with two exceptions:\n  • You cannot hurt a player in your &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="GettingStarted_Social"&gt;Group or Company&lt;/a&gt;\n  • You cannot hurt a non-criminal in a &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="GettingStarted_Sanctuaries"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, which includes most &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="GettingStarted_Outposts"&gt;Outposts&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTo prevent you from committing crimes accidentally, you must enable Criminal Intent (default: [U]) in order to damage players or player-made structures, including &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Camping"&gt;Camps&lt;/a&gt;. Players who have enabled their Criminal Intent but have not actually committed a crime have their names appear in &lt;font color="#ffc321"&gt;yellow&lt;/font&gt;. A player who has committed a crime will have their name shown in &lt;font color="#ff9393"&gt;red&lt;/font&gt;.\n\nCrime comes with punishment. The magic of Aeternum is less forgiving, and offers little respite for criminals. When a player commits a crime, they receive a Criminal Timer. This is increased with subsequent crimes up to a maximum value. When a player has time remaining on their Criminal Timer, they:\n  • Can be attacked by other players. Those other players will not receive criminal penalties for attacking the criminal.\n  • Can be attacked in Sanctuaries. This means even Outposts are not safe for criminals.\n  • Drop their Equipment in addition to their Inventory when they die. They will respawn with nothing, and others can pick up the weapons and armor they've dropped.\n\nPlayers can commit 4 different crimes. The worst crime they still have a timer for is listed in their nameplate. These crimes are:\n  • Vandalism: damaging a player-made structure\n  • Pillaging: destroying a player-made structure\n  • Assault: damaging another player\n  • Murder: killing another player\n\nRemember, any crimes committed in a &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="GettingStarted_Sanctuaries"&gt;Lawless Area&lt;/a&gt; do not add to your Criminal Timer, and do not carry the usual penalties. If you're looking for ad-hoc player vs. player combat, Lawless Areas offer a way to find that without the same level of punishment as elsewhere in Aeternum.\n\nCrime comes with a lot of risk. Be careful if you choose that path, and be aware of the costs.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_Mechanics_Reporting">Reporting Abusive Behavior</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Mechanics_Reporting">Interactions with other players can come in many forms. Some are mutually positive, like members of a Company working together to complete a large structure. Some are inherently adversarial, like murder and War. However, none of these interactions should become abusive.\n\nAbusive or discriminatory language, cheating or exploiting, individual harrasment, vulgar character or Company names, and chat spam can all be reported for disciplinary action.\n\nIf you see or experience a player engaging in these behaviors, you can report them using their &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_SocialMenu"&gt;Player Portrait&lt;/a&gt;. Hover over the portrait to open the flyout menu, and select Report. In the dialog box, select the type of inappropriate behavior you wish to report and add some details and context in the text box. Finally, click Submit.\n\nWhile New World presents a hostile world where players can fight and kill each other, it's ultimately a game and should be fun for everyone. Amazon takes these reports seriously, and will follow up appropriately.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_Mechanics_Technical">Technical Issues and Support</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Mechanics_Technical">New World is still in active development, and some issues could arise from this. If you run into any bugs, please let the developers know by reporting them through the forums at https://alphaforum.newworld.com/. The forums offer a direct connection to the devs, and may already have a solution or work-around for your issue, so check there for support.\n\nIf your character gets stuck in a position you cannot escape from, you can type "/unstuck" without the quotes into chat to be moved a short distance away. This command is only intended to be used if you find yourself unable to navigate on your own, like falling between rocks you cannot climb out from. It is not for escaping an enemy base or avoiding a fight. Once you use "/unstuck" you will have to wait a period of time before it becomes available again.</string>

	<string key="Lore_Title_Crafting_Overview">Crafting Overview</string>
	<string key="Lore_Subtitle_Crafting_Overview">The Basic Steps</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Crafting_Overview">Crafting is a major part of New World. Most weapons, armors, tools, and utilities must be crafted by a player. Even players who don't craft items themselves rely on others who do for their equipment.\n\nThe process of crafting an item often involves several steps, some of which require Trade Skills. For steps in the process you don't have the necessary skills for, you'll have to work with another player or check the &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="TradingPost_Overview"&gt;Trading Post&lt;/a&gt; for what you need.\n\nThe steps to craft an item are:\n  1. &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Crafting_Gather"&gt;Gather Raw Resources&lt;/a&gt;\n  2. &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Crafting_Refining"&gt;Refine Materials&lt;/a&gt; - Tier 1 recipes can usually skip this step and use the raw resources directly\n  3. &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Crafting_Recipes"&gt;Craft the Item(s)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIt is often a good idea to work backwards when trying to make a specific item. Use a &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Crafting_Stations"&gt;Crafting Station&lt;/a&gt; to view all of the recipes for that station. Select the type of item you want to make to open the recipe Tiers. Select the Tier of item you wish to make to see its recipe. You can also pin the recipe as an Objective so you can easily keep track of what you need.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_Crafting_Gather">Gathering</string>
	<string key="Lore_Subtitle_Crafting_Gather">Collecting Raw Resources</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Crafting_Gather">Crafting always requires materials. Raw, unrefined resources are gathered from around Aeternum, and usually require using &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Crafting_Gather2"&gt;Gathering Tools&lt;/a&gt;. There are several Trade Skills related to gathering. These increase the number you collect and grant a chance to gather resources of a higher &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Crafting_Rarity"&gt;Rarity&lt;/a&gt;. These skills are also required to &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Crafting_Refining"&gt;refine&lt;/a&gt; that type of resource into higher Tier materials.\n\nSome items don't require tools to gather. Flint can be found on the ground all over Aeternum, but especially along the beaches. Small amounts of Wood can be gathered from bushes without the need for tools. Turkeys can be harvested for meat and feathers without a knife. If a tool you do not have is required, you will see that requirement in place of the option to gather when you approach.\n\nA simple Tier 1 version of each Gathering Tool can be crafted at your &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Camping"&gt;Camp&lt;/a&gt;. They only require Flint and Wood, which can be gathered without tools, and have no skill requirement to craft.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_Crafting_Gather2">Gathering Tools</string>
	<string key="Lore_Subtitle_Crafting_Gather2">Harvesting Resources</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Crafting_Gather2">There are 4 kinds of gathering tools: Logging Axes, Pickaxes, Sickles, and Skinning Knives. Each has a corresponding Trade Skill to increase its effectiveness.\n\nA Logging Axe or Hatchet is used to chop trees to gather Wood. Trees can be found almost anywhere in Aeternum, though in more corrupted areas they may be withered and provide unusable wood. Wyrdwood trees are rare, and tend to grow in dangerous and &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="GettingStarted_Sanctuaries"&gt;Lawless Areas&lt;/a&gt;, but the Wyrdwood they provide is required for the highest Tiers of items. The Logging and Carpentry Trade Skill improves how much you gather from each tree, grants a chance to receive higher Rarity Wood, and allows refining the Wood.\n\nA Pickaxe or Pick is used to gather stone from Boulders and ore from metal veins like Iron Veins. Boulders are common, but are found most densely in Highlands areas. Ore Veins are less common, and are also most likely to be found in Highlands areas. You can use the Map to identify Highlands areas to search. Starmetal and Orichalcum are rare metals that only appear in dangerous and &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="GettingStarted_Sanctuaries"&gt;Lawless Areas&lt;/a&gt;. They are required for the highest recipe Tiers. The Mining, Stonecutting, and Smelting Trade Skill helps you gather more from Boulders and Ore Veins, grant a chance to gather higher Rarity resources, and allows you to refine those resources.\n\nA Sickle is used to harvest various plants, both mundane and alchemical. Throughout Aeternum, plants like Hemp, Vegetables, Herbs, and Alchemical Ingredients can be found growing in the wild. Hemp provides Fibers, which are important to creating cloth and clothing. Vegetables and Herbs are used in many Provisioning recipes to create meals, and can be grown by Companies in their owned Territories. Alchemical Ingredients are unique to Aeternum, and provide the power needed to create Potions and Magical Gauntlets. The Harvesting and Weaving Trade Skill lets you gather more from plants, gives you a chance to gather higher Rarities of resources from plants, and allows you to weave Fibers into cloth.\n\nA Skinning Knife is used to cut Rawhide from dead animals, and to collect their Meat. Many types of wildlife can be found across Aeternum. Most allow the harvesting of Rawhide, but some species like Elk have a chance of providing Animal Horn, and others like Wolves could provide Animal Fangs. Explore to find the types of areas each species prefers. The Tracking, Skinning, and Tanning Trade Skill lets you harvest more resources from animals, gives you a chance to harvest higher Rarities of those resources, allows you to tan Rawhide into leather, and gives you the ability to track animals on your Compass at the top of the screen.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_Crafting_Refining">Refining</string>
	<string key="Lore_Subtitle_Crafting_Refining">Creating Higher Tier Materials</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Crafting_Refining">Most recipes require materials that have been refined. Refining is done at Refining Stations, which can be found at &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="GettingStarted_Outposts"&gt;Outposts&lt;/a&gt; or built by Companies on their Territories. Refining Stations have Tiers associated with them and can only refine materials up to that Tier.\n\nThe Woodshop is used to refine Wood into Timber, Lumber, and Planks. It requires ranks in the Logging and Carpentry Trade Skill to use, and higher Tier refining requires a higher level of skill.\n\nThe Smelter is used to refine precious metals into Ingots, as well as to create Charcoal from Wood. Ranks in the Mining, Stonecutting, and Smelting Trade Skill are required to smelt Ingots, but anyone can create Charcoal. A higher rank is required to craft higher Tier Ingots.\n\nThe Loom is used to weave Fibers into cloth like Linen, Sateen, and Silk. It requires ranks in the Harvesting and Weaving Trade Skill to create cloth, with higher Tiers requiring more ranks.\n\nThe Tanning Station is used to turn Rawhide into Leather. It requires ranks in the Tracking, Skinning, and Tanning Trade Skill to use, and requires more ranks to craft higher Tiers of Leather.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_Crafting_Stations">Crafting Stations</string>
	<string key="Lore_Subtitle_Crafting_Stations">Where Things Get Made</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Crafting_Stations">Crafting Stations are structures where crafting can be done. Each allows crafting recipes of a certain type, and require a different Trade Skill to use. Crafting Stations can be found in &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="GettingStarted_Outposts"&gt;Outposts&lt;/a&gt; or built by Companies on their Territories. Each has a Tier, and can only be used to craft recipes of that Tier or below.\n\nForges have recipes for Melee Weapons, Shields, Gathering Tools, and Heavy Armors.\n\nWorkshops have recipes for Ranged Weapons, Ammunition, and Siege Weapons.\n\nOutfitting Stations have recipes for Light and Medium Armors, Bags, and Trinkets.\n\nKitchens have recipes for food and drinks that provide a wide range of benefits in addition to filling your &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_FoodDrink"&gt;Food&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_FoodDrink"&gt;Drink&lt;/a&gt; meter.\n\nArcane Repositories have recipes for Tinctures, Potions, Weapon Coatings, and Magical Gauntlets.\n\nYour &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Camping"&gt;Camp&lt;/a&gt; is also a Crafting Station, but is a bit unique in that it has recipes for a very wide range of items. Many of these recipes don't require refined resources, but don't always have options for every Tier. The Tier of your Camp and the ability to craft the recipes found there is determined by your ranks in the Wilderness Survival Trade Skill.\n\nWhile viewing a Crafting Station, you can use the tabs at the top to switch to viewing recipes from any other Crafting Station. However, you cannot craft items for a station you are not using.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_Crafting_Recipes">Crafting Recipes</string>
	<string key="Lore_Subtitle_Crafting_Recipes">How Things Get Made</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Crafting_Recipes">When you visit a &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Crafting_Stations"&gt;Crafting Station&lt;/a&gt;, you are presented with a number of types of items. If the item is presented in white, you have the materials and skill to craft one or more of its Tiers. If the item is in red, you are missing one or more of the requirements. You can click the item to view the specific Tiers and Recipes either way.\n\nAfter selecting an item type, you can see the different Tiers of the item this station can craft. Click a different Tier's column to view its Recipe. While viewing a Recipe, you can select what &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Crafting_Rarity"&gt;Rarity&lt;/a&gt; of each material you want to use, and see how those changes affect your odds of crafting it at each possible Craftsmanship level. For equippable items, you can switch from the Craftsmanship view to see the resulting item's stats, or you can hover your mouse over each section of the Quality Bar to see the item's stats should you roll that Craftsmanship.\n\nIf you lack the materials to craft any given recipe, you can choose to pin that recipe to the HUD as an Objective. Doing this keeps all the required ingredients visible as you play, so you can easily keep track of what to seek out.\n\nIt's very common that you cannot refine all the materials needed for a recipe. You'll need to work with other players or use the &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="TradingPost_Overview"&gt;Trading Post&lt;/a&gt; to get anything you can't supply yourself.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_Crafting_Rarity">Rarity and Craftsmanship</string>
	<string key="Lore_Subtitle_Crafting_Rarity">Quality in Material and Execution</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Crafting_Rarity">Many items can have a Rarity and a Craftsmanship rating.\n\nTo craft an item of a higher Rarity, you need to use higher Rarity materials. As the name suggests, higher Rarity materials are tougher to obtain. They require more ranks in the relevant gathering Trade Skill as well as a bit of luck to obtain.\n\nCraftsmanship is a representation of how well made an item is. If you have enough ranks in the relevant crafting Trade Skill, you have a chance to craft items of higher quality.\n\nUsing a higher Rarity of the primary material will increase the Rarity of the final item, which is always better. Using a higher Rarity of any material, including the primary material, combines with your ranks in the corresponding Trade Skill to increase your chances of crafting at a higher Craftsmanship. You can see your chances of crafting at each possible Craftsmanship level while viewing the Recipe. Just like Rarity, having a higher Craftsmanship results in an item with better stats.\n\nWhen you craft the item, you automatically make a Crafting Roll. You'll see the results of your roll on the Quality Bar when making the item.\n\nItems that are both high Rarity and high Craftsmanship are extremely valuable. Making these requires a significant amount of investment, both in the form of skill and valuable resources.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Chapter_TradingPost">Trading Post</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_TradingPost_Overview">Trading Post Overview</string>
	<string key="Lore_Subtitle_TradingPost_Overview">Buying and Selling in New World</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_TradingPost_Overview">Every &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="GettingStarted_Outposts"&gt;Outpost&lt;/a&gt; in Aeternum includes a Trading Post. There you can buy and sell items for Coin.\n\nThe market is entirely player driven. Every item available for sale was posted by a player, and every item you wish to sell must be bought by a player. The only exceptions are Talismans and Animorum, which are dropped by Corrupted and Angry Earth enemies. These items can be sold directly to the Trading Post for Coin, and have no other purpose.\n\nTrading Posts offer three views:\n  • The &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="TradingPost_BuyTab"&gt;Buy Tab&lt;/a&gt;\n  • The &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="TradingPost_SellTab"&gt;Sell Tab&lt;/a&gt;\n  • The &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="TradingPost_MyOrders"&gt;My Orders Tab&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Trading Post works on the concept of postings and orders. Players can post items for sale, and they can also order items for purchase. Doing this requires a fee determined by how much the post or order is worth and how long it will be available.\n\nEvery Outpost has a separate inventory. Items and orders are placed at a specific Outpost's Trading Post, and are not transferable. You can view items and orders at different Outposts by using the location dropdown menu to select another location, but you cannot make the purchase or sale without traveling there.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_TradingPost_BuyTab">The Buy Tab</string>
	<string key="Lore_Subtitle_TradingPost_BuyTab">Making Purchases</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_TradingPost_BuyTab">All purchases are made through the Trading Post's Buy Tab. There are two methods of making a purchase:\n  • Browse posted items, and buy them directly\n  • Place a Buy Order for a specific item to be fulfilled later by another player\n\nDirect purchases are simple. You can browse all the items that have been posted by looking through the list. You can filter these items using the search bar or the category options on the left. When you find an item you want to buy, just select it to see a breakdown of the costs, including a tax charged by the Trading Post. Once you buy the item, it will be added to your Inventory. You can only purchase items that were posted to the Outpost you are at.\n\nIf you can't find the item you want, or it isn't available for a price you'll accept, you can place a Buy Order. To place a Buy Order, you need to identify the specific item you want by using the search bar or clicking into the filters until you find it. Once you drill down to the item, you will be presented with the option to order it. Clicking the button will open a window where you can define how many, what Rarity or Craftsmanship you'll accept (if applicable for the item), how much you're willing to pay, and the maximum time the order should remain active for. When the order is fulfilled, the item will be added to the Outpost Storage where you placed the order.\n\nPlacing a Buy Order requires paying a Listing Fee, which is determined by a combination of the price you are offering, the quantity, and the duration. If you do not have enough Coin for the Listing Fee, you cannot place the order. This fee is not refunded if the order expires.\n\nThe Buy Tab is also where you can purchase a Claim Charter, which is necessary to claim a Territory for your Company.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_TradingPost_SellTab">The Sell Tab</string>
	<string key="Lore_Subtitle_TradingPost_SellTab">Selling Items for Coin</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_TradingPost_SellTab">Items can be sold using the Trading Post's Sell Tab. Most items are sold using one of two methods:\n  • Fulfilling a Buy Order\n  • Posting an item\n\nTalismans and Animorum are exceptions. These items can only be sold directly to the Trading Post by clicking the button in the top left of the Sell Tab. They have no other use, so sell any you have every time you visit.\n\nFulfilling a Buy Order is a mirror of purchasing an item. When you select an item to sell, you will be shown any open orders for that item. Alternatively, you can switch to viewing All Items to see what orders have been placed even if you don't have the item being requested. When you click on an open order, you'll be able to select how many to sell if the order is for multiple, and how much you'll make from the sale. Click Sell Now to make the transaction immediately.\n\nPosting an item is done by selecting the item from the list in the My Sellable Items view. Clicking the button opens a window that lets you set the quantity, price, and duration of your posting. Each of these values factors into the Listing Fee, which you'll need to pay to post your item. Once posted, the item will be removed from your inventory or storage and held until it is sold or the posting expires. If the posting expires, the item will be returned to the Outpost Storage where you posted the item. The Listing Fee is non-refundable.</string>

	<string key="Lore_Body_TradingPost_MyOrders">The My Orders tab allows you to see all of your open Buy Orders, items you've posted for sale, and your past transactions.

However, level alone is not a full measure of someone's combat or crafting effectiveness. It depends on how those points were allocated.\n\nAs you fight, gather, and craft you will earn XP. When you've accrued enough XP you will gain a Level. The amount of XP you need to earn varies, increasing as your level does. Earning level 10 requires more XP than earning level 2.\n\nYou can see your current progress towards your next level along the bottom of the screen. When you gain XP, you will see the amount added appear briefly and the bar will fill further. When it fills completely, you gain a Level.\n\nWhen you gain a Level, you are awarded points to spend on either Attributes or Trade Skills. These points are not interchangable, and which you gain and how many depends on the Level you just reached. Gaining a Level provides no other benefit, so you have to spend your points on the Progression screen (default: [K]) to improve your abilities.</string>

Having more ranks in these skills allows you to craft more recipes and grants improved chances to craft with a higher &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Crafting_Rarity"&gt;Craftsmanship&lt;/a&gt;. These are:\n  • Blacksmithing\n  • Engineering\n  • Outfitting\n  • Cooking\n  • Alchemy\n\nGathering and Refining\nThese skills are required to refine resources at &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Crafting_Refining"&gt;Refining Stations&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to granting the ability to refine resources, higher ranks also improve your ability to gather the related resource and grant a chance of getting a higher &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Crafting_Rarity"&gt;Rarity&lt;/a&gt; of raw material. These are:\n  • Logging and Carpentry\n  • Mining, Stonecutting, and Smelting\n  • Harvesting and Weaving\n  • Tracking, Skinning, and Tanning\n\nPersonal Skills\nThese skills can cover a range of abilities. Each has use outside of &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="GettingStarted_Outposts"&gt;Outposts&lt;/a&gt;. These are:\n  • Wilderness Survival: this improves the Tier of your &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Camping"&gt;Camp&lt;/a&gt;, and unlocks the ability to craft more recipes there\n  • Repairing: this allows you to repair items at the cost of fewer resources and with a decreased loss of maximum durability</string>

	<string key="Lore_Body_Companies_Overview">Every player in New World is a member of a Company, even if they are the only member of their own. Players can join each other's Companies, which allows them to work together to achieve things they couldn't alone.\n\nTo invite someone to your Company, use the flyout on their &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_SocialMenu"&gt;Player Portrait&lt;/a&gt;. To join someone else's Company, you will need to be invited in the same way. Once you've received an invitation, you can accept it from the &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_SocialMenu"&gt;Social Menu&lt;/a&gt;. \n\nYou do not need to leave your Company before joining another. You will be removed from your previous Company automatically.\n\nAll claimed &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Companies_Territories"&gt;Territories&lt;/a&gt; and player-built &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Companies_Building"&gt;Structures&lt;/a&gt; are owned by Companies, and can be used by any member with adequate &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Companies_Ranks"&gt;permissions&lt;/a&gt;. This means that any Territory you claim or Structure you build is to the benefit of your Company and all its members. Conversely, leaving a Company means you lose access to those Structures since it's the Company that owns them, not the player.\n\nCompanies will also want to capture and defend Territories. They usually do this through &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Companies_War"&gt;War&lt;/a&gt;, which allows them to fight each other without the usual &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Crime"&gt;criminal penalties&lt;/a&gt;. Wars also include a Siege phase, during which the Defender's Territories' protection can be bypassed.\n\nCompanies have Treasuries that the Governor and Consuls can withdraw from. Any member of the Company can provide money to this Treasury, making it easy to collect funds for Company use, like buying &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Companies_Territories"&gt;Claim Charters&lt;/a&gt;.\n\nUp to 50 players can be in a single Company. Players cannot be members of multiple Companies at once.</string>

	<string key="Lore_Body_Companies_Ranks">Company members each have a Rank. Depending on their Rank, members have access to perform various actions on behalf of the Company.\n\nEvery Company has a Governor who has all possible permissions. The Governor is the leader of the Company, and holds the power to set the status of every other member. For the Governor to leave the Company, they must promote a different member to be the new Governor. The only exception is if the Governor is the only member of the Company, in which case they cannot leave it without joining a new one.\n\nThe Ranks tab of the &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_UI"&gt;Company screen&lt;/a&gt; allows you to explore all the available ranks and their permissions. Additionally, most Company &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Companies_Building"&gt;Structures&lt;/a&gt; can have a rank requirement set. This allows Companies to have even more fine grain control over who can use each Structure.\n\nHigher ranks offer a member more potential since they can access more aspects of the Company, but they also offer risk to the Company because the member could then sabotage things. Beware of spies and double agents.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_Companies_Treasury">Company Treasury</string>
	<string key="Lore_Subtitle_Companies_Treasury">Shared Coffers for a Company</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Companies_Treasury">Many aspects of managing a Company require funding. To that end, Companies have Treasuries. These act as a shared location for storing the Company's funds.\n\nAny member of a Company may deposit Coin into the Company Treasury. To do this, use either the Treasury tab in the &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_UI"&gt;Company screen&lt;/a&gt; or the Give Coin button in your &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Inventory"&gt;Inventory&lt;/a&gt;.\n\nOnly a Company's &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Companies_Ranks"&gt;Governor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Companies_Ranks"&gt;Consuls&lt;/a&gt; can withdraw from the Treasury. The Governor can withdraw any amount at any time. They can also set a limit for how much Coin that the Consuls can withdraw in one day. Consuls may only withdraw Coin up to this limit. The Governor could also choose to remove this limit altogether.\n\nThe Treasury is a great way to collect the required Coin for &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Companies_Territories"&gt;Territory protection&lt;/a&gt;, new &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Companies_Territories"&gt;Claim Charters&lt;/a&gt;, and declaring &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Companies_War"&gt;War&lt;/a&gt;.</string>

	<string key="Lore_Subtitle_Companies_Territories">Claiming Land</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Companies_Territories">In order to start building &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Companies_Building"&gt;Structures&lt;/a&gt;, a Company must claim Territory. Territories are spread around Aeternum, and vary in size and resources. There is no limit to the number of Territories a single Company can hold.\n\nIn order to claim a Territory, a member of the Company must use a Claim Charter on the vacant Protection Ward. Claim Charters are purchased at &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="TradingPost_BuyTab"&gt;Trading Posts&lt;/a&gt;. They cost a lot and can be dropped just like any other item, so be careful when carrying the Charter to the Territory.\n\nIf a Territory is already held by another Company, it cannot be claimed until its Protection Ward is destroyed. If protection is not active for the Territory, this can be done through &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Crime"&gt;Criminal action&lt;/a&gt;. If protection is up on the Territory, then the Company that wishes to take the Territory must declare &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Companies_War"&gt;War&lt;/a&gt;.\n\nOnce claimed, Company members with adequate &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Companies_Ranks"&gt;permissions&lt;/a&gt; can manage aspects of the Territory from its Protection Ward. At the Protection Ward, you can improve the Tier of your Territory and purchase protection for it.\n\nUpgrading a Protection Ward allows the construction of higher Tiers of &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Companies_Building"&gt;Structures&lt;/a&gt;. When you interact with the Protection Ward and choose to upgrade it, a new Blueprint is placed over the Protection Ward. You must then supply the required resources as you would any other Blueprint in order to complete the upgrade.\n\nPurchasing protection for a Territory prevents all Structures, including the Protection Ward itself, from being damaged. This protection can be bypassed briefly during a &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Companies_Siege"&gt;Siege&lt;/a&gt;, but is otherwise impenetrable. Keeping protection up on a Territory allows you to not have to worry about bandits and raiders destroying your progress. Protection requires both Coin and Azoth to maintain.\n\nRemember that protection only applies within a certain radius of the Protection Ward, and it does not protect players.</string>

	<string key="Lore_Body_Companies_Building">If a player has the &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Companies_Ranks"&gt;permissions&lt;/a&gt; to do so, they can build Structures in any &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Companies_Territories"&gt;Territories&lt;/a&gt; that their Company owns. Building is done by first placing a Blueprint, then supplying the required resources.\n\nTo place a Blueprint, enable Build Mode (default: [B]). Using Build Mode, you can navigate possible Blueprints using the mouse wheel. When you've found what you want to build, move to where you want the Structure to go and place it, much like you do with your &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Camping"&gt;Camp&lt;/a&gt;. You can only place Blueprints up to the same Tier as the Territory's Protection Ward.\n\nOnce placed, you need to supply the Blueprint with material to actually construct it. These resources are supplied from your &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Inventory"&gt;Inventory&lt;/a&gt;. They do not have to be added all at once, allowing you to make multiple trips.\n\nStructures that can be used, like &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Crafting_Refining"&gt;Refining Stations&lt;/a&gt; and Storage Containers, can have a minimum rank set to use it.

	<string key="Lore_Body_Companies_War">In order to capture &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Companies_Territories"&gt;Territories&lt;/a&gt; from each other, Companies can declare War. To declare War, you can use the Map or the All Companies menu. Declaring War costs a significant amount of Coin, and you can only declare War on a Company that owns at least one Territory. The exact cost varies based on a number of factors, including difference in size between the Companies.\n\nWar plays out in a number of Phases, each with slightly different rules of engagement.\n\nWhen War is first declared, it enters the Pre-War phase. During this phase, the Companies still may not attack each other without commiting a &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Crime"&gt;crime&lt;/a&gt;. This phase grants the Defending Company the opportunity to muster their forces, and prevents surprise attacks while most of a Company's members are offline.\n\nAfter the Pre-War phase comes the Battle phase. During this phase, the involved Companies can attack each other freely without any criminal punishment. Territory protections are active, however. The length of the Battle phase can vary depending on when the War was started and what time the Defender's Siege Window is set for.\n\nThe next phase is Siege. The Siege phase takes place during the Defending Company's &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Companies_Siege"&gt;Siege Window&lt;/a&gt;. During this phase, the Attacking Company can bypass the Defending Company's protection on their Territories. This means the attacker can destroy one of the Defender's Protection Wards even if they've paid for protection. This phase ends early if a Protection Ward is successfully destroyed.\n\nAfter the Siege phase, the War enters a Resolution phase. The Companies can still attack each other during this phase just like during the Battle phase. However, during this phase the Defending Company can declare a counter attack. This is a special way of declaring War that costs less than the initial attack and skips the Pre-War phase. Instead, a counter attack's Battle phase starts immediately after the Resolution phase ends. If no counter attack is declared, the War ends when the Resolution phase does.\n\nYou can see the times that each phase will take place in the popup that appears when you choose to declare War, before committing and spending the Coin. While at War, you can check on what phase it is in and when the next one starts in the Wars tab of the &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_UI"&gt;Company screen&lt;/a&gt;.</string>

This is the time of day that a &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Companies_War"&gt;Siege phase&lt;/a&gt; will take place when defending in a War.\n\nIt is very important to set this time to a time that most of the Company's members are available! This time must be set before the War begins, so set it as soon as possible. If you are the &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Companies_Ranks"&gt;Governor&lt;/a&gt; of your Company, make efforts to ask your members what time works for them most reliably. If War is declared on you and none of your members are online during your Siege Window, the attackers will be able to take one of your &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Companies_Territories"&gt;Territories&lt;/a&gt; uncontested, even if you've paid for protection.\n\nTo set your Company's Siege Window, use the Siege Window tab in the &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_UI"&gt;Company screen&lt;/a&gt;.</string>

	<string key="Lore_Body_Combat_Overview">*Note: All controls are default, and can be changed in the Settings screen\n\nAeternum is often a dangerous place. Mastering combat is important to your survival. Territorial beasts, corrupted settlers, other players, and even the world itself will try to bring about your early demise. You'd best be prepared.\n\nMany different weapons and techniques are available to use, but all require an understanding of the ebbs and flows of a fight. You'll need to switch between &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Combat_Attacking"&gt;attacking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Combat_Defending"&gt;defending&lt;/a&gt; in order to manage your &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Vitals"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt;. Remember that running out of Stamina leaves you vulnerable, unable to dodge, block, or attack effectively.\n\nWhen entering a fight, prepare by drawing your weapon. This can be done by either pressing the number that corresponds to the Quickslot you've placed the weapon in ([1], [2], or [3]), or by pressing [X] to draw the last weapon you used. While your weapon is drawn, you move slower and sprinting costs Stamina. Only draw your weapon when you're ready to fight, and sheathe it by pressing the same button again when the fight is over.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_Combat_Attacking">Attacking in Combat</string>
	<string key="Lore_Subtitle_Combat_Attacking">Dealing Damage</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Combat_Attacking">*Note: All controls are default, and can be changed in the Settings screen\n\nSimply wielding a weapon won't dissuade many of your enemies. You'll have to use it. There are a variety of weapons to choose from, each with its own nuances, but they fall into two broad categories: melee and ranged.\n\nMelee weapons are used up close. These are things like swords, spears, clubs, and battleaxes. Each melee weapon has 3 attacks:\n  • Standard Attack ([LMB]): the base attack for the weapon, and the one you'll likely use most often\n  • Heavy Attack ([F]): a slow, high damage attack that makes use of &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Combat_Grit"&gt;GRIT&lt;/a&gt; and can break through blocks\n  • Special Attack ([Q]): this varies by weapon, and costs Mana instead of Stamina to use. For example, using this with a sword does a quick slash and stab combo, but using this with a spear switches to a throwing mode allowing you to use the spear as a ranged weapon\n  • Sprinting Attack ([SHIFT] + [LMB]): lunges forward during the attack and deals good damage, but can cost a lot of Stamina\n\nYou can also equip a shield with any one-handed melee weapon. Shields offer much better &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Combat_Defending"&gt;Blocking Absorption&lt;/a&gt; than a weapon alone, but also replace the Special Attack with a quick but low damage shield bash.\n\nThe damage you do with a melee weapon scales with different &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Progression_Attributes"&gt;Attributes&lt;/a&gt; depending on the weapon. Most commonly this is Strength.\n\nRanged weapons are the opposite of melee weapons. They are best used at a distance, and don't offer different attacks. While wielding a ranged weapons, aim it by holding [RMB] and then fire by clicking [LMB]. Clicking [LMB] without aiming will swing the weapon, hopefully clearing you enough space to fire again or retreat.\n\nFirearms like muskets fire their round very quickly, so you don't have to judge travel time to the target. However, they take time to reload.\n\nBows suffer from the arrow traveling more slowly, and it will drop as gravity affects it. They can fire more quickly than firearms, though.\n\nThe damage you deal with ranged weapons scales with your &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Progression_Attributes"&gt;Dexterity Attribute&lt;/a&gt;.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_Combat_Defending">Defending in Combat</string>
	<string key="Lore_Subtitle_Combat_Defending">Avoiding Damage</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Combat_Defending">*Note: All controls are default, and can be changed in the Settings screen\n\nWhile you can't win a fight without damaging your enemy, it is often defense that determines the victor. Avoiding or limiting damage can give you the advantage you need to swing a close fight in your favor. There are two main ways to defend: dodging and blocking.\n\nDodging can cost a lot of &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Vitals"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt;, but if done well it prevents all damage simply because you aren't hit. You can dodge at any time by pressing [SPACE] to roll. Holding a direction ([W], [A], [S], or [D]) when you press [SPACE] will cause you to roll in that direction, allowing you to not only avoid the attack but end your dodge in an advantageous position.\n\nDodging is not without risk, though. If you fail in your timing or direction, you will be hit just as hard as if you'd done nothing, and you will still have spent the Stamina. Masterful dodging can win a fight, but poor dodging can lose one.\n\nBlocking is much easier, but doesn't prevent all damage. With a melee weapon equipped, you can hold [RMB] to block attacks from in front of you. While blocking, you decrease the damage the attack does by a large percentage, which depends on the weapon or shield you're using. You also spend some Stamina. However, the risk is much lower than dodging, and you hold your ground. Be careful to avoid heavy attacks, though, as these may break through your block and deal full damage.\n\nEquipping a shield gives you the best possible blocking &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Combat_DefenseAbsorption"&gt;absorption&lt;/a&gt;. However, they tend to be heavy and affect your &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Combat_EquipLoad"&gt;Equip Load&lt;/a&gt;.</string>

	<string key="Lore_Subtitle_Combat_DefenseAbsorption">Using Armor</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Combat_DefenseAbsorption">Even the most nimble combatant will eventually be hit. When that happens, your Defense and Absorption stats determine how much of the attack's damage affects you. Defense and Absorption are mostly determined by the armor you are wearing, although some other factors like your &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Progression_Attributes"&gt;Attributes&lt;/a&gt; and various &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Combat_StatusEffects"&gt;Status Effects&lt;/a&gt; can affect them. You can see your current Defense and Absorption stats on the &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Inventory"&gt;Equipment&lt;/a&gt; screen.\n\nDefense is a flat number for each &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Combat_AttackTypes"&gt;Attack Type&lt;/a&gt;, and is mostly based on how much of your character is covered by armor of any sort. Cloth gloves provide the same amount of defense as gloves made of steel. Wearing a strong chestpiece but no hat will provide less defense than wearing leather chest and headwear. Defenses are also increased by certain Attributes, like Physique improving your defense to &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Combat_AttackTypes"&gt;Physical Attacks&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, equipping up to a &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Combat_EquipLoad"&gt;Heavy Equip Load&lt;/a&gt; will grant a bonus to your Physical Defenses.\n\nAbsorption is a percentage for each &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Combat_AttackTypes"&gt;Attack Type&lt;/a&gt;, and is derived from the specific pieces of armor you've equipped. Unlike Defense, a heavy chestpiece will have higher Absorption ratings than a light chestpiece of the same Tier. Absorptions are a key differentiator among equipment, and are shown within the items' tooltips.\n\nWhen you take damage, your Defense and Absorption to the attack's type are used to decrease the amount of damage you take. First, your Defense value is subtracted from the damage. Then, that new value is decreased by your Absorption percentage.\n\nBlocking improves your Absorption to all damage types for the attack you blocked.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_Combat_Afflictions">Afflictions</string>
	<string key="Lore_Subtitle_Combat_Afflictions">Extra Effects of Damage</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Combat_Afflictions">Some attacks or environments can cause harm in ways other than direct damage. These other forms of damage are called Afflictions.\n\nCharacters have a Resistance score for each possible Affliction. These Resistances are determined mostly by your equipment, although several &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Progression_Attributes"&gt;Attributes&lt;/a&gt; affect them as well. You can see your current Resistance scores on the &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Inventory"&gt;Equipment&lt;/a&gt; screen.\n\nWhen you take Affliction damage, your Resistance is depleted by that amount. If you run out of Resistance, you become Afflicted. This has different effects for each type of Affliction:\n  • &lt;font color="#9db629"&gt;Poison&lt;/font&gt;: deals moderate damage over a long time, and will likely kill you if you do not rest at your &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Camping"&gt;Camp&lt;/a&gt;.\n  • &lt;font color="#9d1bda"&gt;Corruption&lt;/font&gt;: deals massive damage over a short time, and will likely kill you before you can address it. Avoid this at all costs.\n  • &lt;font color="#c92020"&gt;Wound&lt;/font&gt;: greatly diminishes the rate that you regenerate &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Vitals"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt;.\n  • &lt;font color="#5666e8"&gt;Frostbite&lt;/font&gt;: prevents you from running or dodging.\n  • &lt;font color="#b3af37"&gt;Disease&lt;/font&gt;: quickly depletes your &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_FoodDrink"&gt;Food and Drink&lt;/a&gt; meters.\n\nThere is one more Affliction that behaves slightly differently, and that's Drowning. If your head is underwater for too long, you die. Your Resistance to Drowning can't be improved, and no attack can cause it.</string>
	<string key="Lore_Title_Combat_Grit">GRIT</string>
	<string key="Lore_Subtitle_Combat_Grit">Overwhelming Assault</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Combat_Grit">Normally when a character is hit, they suffer a short stagger during which they cannot act. This stagger also interrupts most actions, including attacks. GRIT allows an attacker to overcome this limitation for a short time.\n\nCertain actions activate GRIT for a character. This can be identified by their body being wreathed in gold. While GRIT is active, the character will continue their action even if they are hit. &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Combat_Attacking"&gt;Heavy Attacks&lt;/a&gt; with melee weapons usually activate GRIT, allowing the attacker to perform their slow and powerful attack even if a faster attack hits them in the meantime.\n\nGRIT has limits, and can be broken through if enough damage has been dealt recently. Having a &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Combat_EquipLoad"&gt;Heavy Equip Load&lt;/a&gt; increases the amount of damage you need to take before your GRIT is broken. \n\nMost of the time, when you see a character glow in gold it's best to avoid whatever is coming rather than attempt to interrupt it.</string>

	<string key="Lore_Body_Combat_AttackTypes">Different attacks may deal different types of damage. Ultimately, these all deal damage to a character's &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Vitals"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;. What's important about Attack Types is that they determine which &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Combat_DefenseAbsorption"&gt;Defense and Absorption&lt;/a&gt; stats are used to reduce the damage the attack does.\n\nThere are 9 Attack Types divided into 2 categories.\n\nPhysical Attacks\n  • Standard: a catch-all category that many beasts and monsters deal\n  • Slash: damage caused by chopping, dealt by things like sword or axe swings\n  • Thrust: damage caused by impaling, dealt by things like sword thrusts or arrows\n  • Strike: damage caused by blunt impact, dealt by things like clubs\n  • Siege: damage designed to damage structures, and uses your Standard Defense and Absorption\n\nElemental Attacks\n  • Magic: damage caused by supernatural effects other than Corruption\n  • Lightning: damage caused by electricity\n  • Fire: damage caused by flame and extreme heat\n  • Void: unnatural damage effective against uncorrupted targets</string>

	<string key="Lore_Subtitle_Combat_EquipLoad">Quickness vs. Toughness</string>
	<string key="Lore_Body_Combat_EquipLoad">The weight of all the items you have equipped, including in your Quickslots, impacts your Equip Load. You can check your current Equip Load in the top left of the &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Inventory"&gt;Equipment&lt;/a&gt; screen. The maximum is determined by your &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Progression_Attributes"&gt;Physique Attribute&lt;/a&gt;.\n\nBased on the weight of your equipment, your Equip Load may fall into 1 of 4 categories:\n\n  • Light: you'll move a little faster, regenerate &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Vitals"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt; more quickly, and dodge further. You probably won't have very high Absorption stats if you manage to stay in this category, though.\n  • Normal: this is the baseline and does not modify your stats. This usually means you are wearing medium armor, or light armor with a lot of Quickslots filled.\n  • Heavy: you move a bit slower, can't roll very far, and regenerate &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Vitals"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt; slower. However, you also gain improved &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Combat_DefenseAbsorption"&gt;Defenses&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Combat_AttackTypes"&gt;Physical Attacks&lt;/a&gt; and your &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Combat_Grit"&gt;GRIT&lt;/a&gt; is tougher to break.\n  • Over-Equipped: you have too much weight equipped, and suffer a number of negative effects. You cannot dodge or sprint, and your &lt;a action="GoToPage" data="Mechanics_Vitals"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt; regenerates even slower than Heavy.

I have left him to his thoughts, and left the attack at the Dig Site behind us as best I can.\n\nThere are an unusual number of the dead surrounding the ruins here – some lie on the ground, as if they collapsed where they stood, some still remain standing, blades in hand, as if they were slain in a single, frozen moment. The armor and weapons have markings like that on the Ancient structures on the isle. Are these the ancient colonists - or merely their servants – or soldiers? \n\nEvery skeleton is intact – no sign of broken bones, merely the flesh eaten down to the white… no insects, no spiders, nothing crawls upon them, and what caused them to remain standing, I do not know. Perhaps it was part of the power that keeps some of us deathless upon the isle? \n\n-Grenville</string>

	<string key="Grenville_Subtitle_02_02">Circles within circles</string>
	<string key="Grenville_Body_02_02">Maddie's words again proved true – the skeletons on the outskirts of the structure have small spheres, with markings much like the Great Spheres, embedded in their chests. They were not posed as warnings – they seemed to have lived once, and I could see the trails they had worn in the stone and the temple perimeter, as if they had walked a circle about it countless times… yet simply one day, stopped. I took one of the spheres for study. \n\nTomorrow, Rolfe – if he will come, fear is continually evident on his face – and I will press on into the temple proper.\n\n-Grenville</string>

A division of the self, a representation of duality, perhaps? In one of the statue's hands was a weapon, the other a familiar orb, outstretched – perhaps it was a religious symbol. Or something to channel other forces perhaps?\n\nI found another skeleton, intact, but with a spear and armor, unlike the ones on the perimeter outside. A leader or ruler, perhaps? It had not been buried, it seemed more a guard of the stone coffer within the temple.\n\n-G</string>

Rolfe said we must not leave… the temple might be dangerous, but what wandered in the dark outside was far more dangerous. \n\nAnd so we waited the night, neither of us sleeping – just when we thought the night had become safe and still, another ghostlit figure would float from beyond the trees, as if reminding us they were never far and they would never leave as long as night was upon the temple.\n\nMay we make it through the night, we will leave this place, head to the great obelisks to the West, perhaps. The skeletons around the perimeter and inside the temple – I should have heeded the warning. At least they have not arisen as the wraiths have, they remain still at their posts, else these would be my last words.\n\n-G</string>

A parting gift, I thought, something that sustained him and not even the fire could burn away.\n\nI did not speak of what I had found, merely buried the keepsake in the fields where Adriaen had labored for the harvest, and then I scattered Adriaen's ashes from the pyre atop it.

I cast the remains away, then returned to where I had taken the flower the day before. To my surprise, new flowers had blossomed where I had buried the keepsake, almost a dozen sprouting forth where none had been the day before.\n\nI am afraid to speak of the matter to Marten. I thought to tell my Mother what I had seen, but then put it out of my mind – she did not want to speak of Adriaen - as if by saying his name we would bring the disease upon us.\n\nKathrijn</string>

It has been days now, and the villagers have taken to whispering amongst themselves.\n\nI did not speak of the flowers I saw where Marten had vanished, and how their color looked red in the dusk, as if drinking in the day's last rays. The flowers grow thickly there as they did at Adriaen's grave – and I have seen them elsewhere in the village as well. The men and women complain about them, how they choke the crops and seem to resist spade and shovel.\n\nThey call them not flowers, but weeds – to me, they still have a beauty about them, and I am glad there is some trace of it on this isle, for there is little joy to be had.\n\nKathrijn</string>

Though I know it would have made mother and father upset, I took a torch and went to see for myself – yet there was nothing, only a thick carpet of flowers, even thicker than before, so thick it was impossible to see if any tracks lay in the dirt.\n\nI remained there for longer than I realized, for when I came to my senses, dawn was rising, and there I was in my nightclothes. Adriaen, I will watch for you, and next time, I shall be swifter – if you are to be found, it is I who will catch you if you wander outside the village.\n\nI took a flower and placed it in the sill, a reminder to you that I still think of you.

It was nearly night before they returned, and they were half their number, their faces white. They would not answer our questions until they were inside, the door and shudders bolted. When I pressed for details, had they found her, they said nothing except that I must put her out of my mind.\n\nThe other men said nothing, merely clutched their weapons to them.\n\nMarisse</string>

	<string key="FiveFarms_Body_01_07">Marten's daughter, Anika, claims to see have seen Kathrijn. She said she saw her with Adriaen, and two other men of the village who had gone missing. I told her where, and she said, “in the flower fields.” I told her to stop telling stories, and she went quiet at my tone. She asked quietly if she could sleep in my room, and I sent her to bed rather sternly. \n\nThe child has taken to sleeping beneath my bed when scared. If it gives her comfort, so be it. The poor child has nowhere else to sleep, and her presence makes Kathrijn's absence… it makes it less, for a time.\n\nMarisse</string>

I cloaked Anika's tale with scorn, expecting him to shake his head sadly and offer sympathy.\n\nInstead, Elias went quiet, not with disbelief, but in that hesitation I know comes from fear of speaking the truth. I pressed him on it – even threatened to strike him, until at last he cried out that he had seen them, too.\n\n“They're not lost,” he said. “They've been coming back. Each of them… sometimes to the fields. We see them walking among the flower beds, but gone at our approach – we work in pairs now, for fear of being led off into whatever hell claimed them.”\n\nI told him that if we were lost out there, we would want to be found. He shook his head. “It is bad enough they have come back to us, we should not go looking for them. They aren't our people, our family anymore - they belong to the island.”\n\nMarisse</string>

It was what I found on my return.\n\nWhen I returned, I immediately went to Marisse's bedroom to see if she had returned - and found flowers scattered about the bed, the same grave flowers that have swallowed our village.\n\nThe flowers… they are so bright when they lie in the earth, violet by day, yet blood red at dusk – and they die so quickly when cut from earth's embrace. We have seen the life this isle brings… we have not seen the death it brings, in all its shapes and kinds.\n\nI fear to say it, but this village is no longer ours.

I didn't tell him I had heard her return. I didn't tell him I had seen the flowers fall. I didn't tell him I was there.\n\nI didn't tell him because he is more scared than me, and adults are not supposed to be scared.\n\nI didn't tell him when she had come home, the floorboards did not make a sound. I didn't tell  him how afraid I was to breathe. How I saw Marisse's feet, dirty, torn, covered in scabs, as she walked slowly around the bed, a black petal falling with each step. I only closed my eyes and prayed until she was gone.\n\nBut she's not gone. None of them are. I need to find a new hiding place where no one knows. [The X].\n\nAnika</string>

They smelled like the flowers in the fields when they are dug up. They don't speak, they simply walk, even do the same things they used to do but they don't do it properly – they do it like they barely remember how.\n\nI don't know how long I can stay here, but they are not leaving. I can hear them moving through the houses even now, their feet scraping on the floorboards, hear their breath. Sometimes… sometimes I think I hear Marisse, whispering my name. She wouldn't hurt me.

If it is her, then I will run to her, and ask her to take me away from this horrid place.\n\nThere is a sound at the door – someone is here. Marisse?\n\nI can smell flowers, freshly cut.

	<string key="AzothTree_Subtitle_01_01">A Letter from Bertand</string>
	<string key="AzothTree_Body_01_01">So Merchand and his band of drunken loons were at it in the inn again, enjoying the adoration of the crowd, telling their usual round of wild tales. I thought they'd draw every beast a mile round to our walls – or perhaps drive them away, which would be the best to be had this night. “The First and Finest Company of Aeternum's Shores,” they've taken to calling themselves, when I think “Fermented” would be best tossed in there as well.\n\nIt was the usual tales of the azoth they've uncovered, the horde of Withered they've butchered from the Cleave and back (which might number three in all, if the claimed bounties are to be believed). Then the drunken shouts and boasts of the rabble turned to how quick one would fell a tree, of all things.\n\nYet one in the crowd spoke up, most carelessly, and said he knew of a tree that none could fell.\n\nThey inn got quiet at this, and Merchand demanded where this tree was. The man – no doubt regretting his unintended challenge – said he had seen it on the Eastern edge of Brightwood, but curiously, it had not always been there – it had risen from the earth not long after the Night of Blue Lanterns. Many in the inn to make the sign to ward off evil.\n\nMerchand, on the contrary, seemed invigorated by this (perhaps seeing a tree as easy prey), and said he would go at once to this tree and “true to his word” (true to his boast more like, and with none but the First and Finest to bear witness) chop it down and bring back its lumber to shore up the walls.\n\nIt has been a week since their departure – and while there's been scattered talk of going to find them, none has volunteered for the task.\n\n- Bertand</string>

	<string key="AzothTree_Subtitle_01_02">A Letter from Bertand</string>
	<string key="AzothTree_Body_01_02">I inquired of the tradesmen in the outpost, and of the “First and Finest” I caught not a word. If they had gone to the great azoth tree in eastern Brightwood, they had not made it this far, even to resupply. More telling of the truth of this was the untapped kegs in the outpost – had they lain empty or shattered, I would have known that Merchand and his band had surely come this way.\n\nI think upon the Night of Blue Lanterns and the rumors of the tree's sudden appearance, and I am uneasy. Perhaps Merchand came upon… not a tree to cut down for its azoth-soaked wood, as he'd hoped, but something that cut him down instead.\n\nThe fact he and his band have not been seen since… perhaps he was not one of the blessed of the isle after all, reborn to try to fell the tree again. Whatever his company's end, this much is clear – none are eager to travel to this so-called azoth tree. For if it had the strength to end Merchand's boasts and make him swallow his pride when he could not, it could certainly silence other bold travelers seeking to follow his footsteps, and quickly, too.\n\n- Bertand</string>

	<string key="AzothTree_Body_01_03">It is I, Yorke, that writes this chronicle, feigning to record Merchand's nightful boasts for “posterity,” and I have not the ink, the parchment, nor patience for all of Merchand's rambling. It is fortunate he cannot read this chronicle, for writing the truth of his adventures is one of the sole joys of his company.\n\nIt is plain to see he and the fellows have some regret for striking out for the “azoth tree” (a fool's errand – what manner of tree suddenly sprouts from the earth, and why would one risk crossing deity or devil for it, esp. seeing what azoth has done elsewhere!). Laying sight upon it, they seemed not driven for fame at cutting down the tree, but confusion as to how they might set about dismantling and hauling it away. None had thought to bring a wagon big enough for the task.\n\nI, for one, do not like camping here. I find the coincidence of the Night of Blue Lanterns and the sudden appearance of this tree to be a warning most clear, not another feat fit for a rabble who playact at a “task worthy of Hercules.”\n\nAs night fell, the Blue Lanterns of the highway seemed to glow brighter, and even the ones in the distance seemed most sharp to my eyes. I write these final lines as Merchand has gone off to slumber, and I'll make up words “worthy of the myth” tomorrow… unless he decided to tear up the parchment in anger, like he has for half of our expeditions that fortune did not favor.\n\n- “The Great Merchand” (i.e., Chronicler Yorke)</string>

	<string key="AzothTree_Subtitle_01_04">Chronicle of the Merchand Company</string>
	<string key="AzothTree_Body_01_04">I did not sleep. I felt as if something was watching us as we camped beneath the tree. Yet when the light of dawn touched the camp, I felt relief, and my fears were dispelled – and the day brought a new joy: Merchand's humiliation!\n\nIt is with no small amusement that I chronicle this – I watched Merchand, then his men, one by one – then in tandem, and finally a half-dozen, all take their hatchets to the tree, and the wood remained untouched! Merchand, finally, his face red, sought about seeking to chop the tree down with curses, to pry at the branches with hatchet and chop at it with sword – but to no avail.\n\nHad he not been so angry, I would have laughed, but the unease I had felt earlier in the day became stronger as night drew on and bid me to keep my tongue. More to my unease, I noticed that Merchand had made no signs of packing up camp – it seemed as if he would work in the light of the moon and the glow of the tree.\n\nYet… the blue light within the tree's wood seemed sharper to my senses as he hacked at it, as if what was within was resisting his efforts. It may have been the trick of the light… but it seemed to grow stronger, pulsing like a heart after every stroke. Turning from the tree, I scanned the growing darkness, but saw naught but the blue lamps burning… except some… seemed moving, as if carried by men.\n\nWhat manner of men carry a flame of azoth to their chest?\n\n- “The Great Merchand” (i.e., Chronicler Yorke)</string>

	<string key="AzothTree_Subtitle_01_05">Chronicle of the Merchand Company</string>
	<string key="AzothTree_Body_01_05">Be warned, traveler – there is a great tree, but do not seek shelter beneath it – others who came before sought to do so, and their bodies lie spread across its roots. I did not bury the ones I saw, for a corpse in Aeternum is an unusual thing if it does not rise, and there was still hope the corpses would vanish in the light of the sun – but it seemed as if they had been there for some time, which was as unsettling as the tree itself.\n\nThe tree seems a lesson in that Aeternum takes its own, and leaves others to rot in the sun. On the crest of one's shield, I recognized the mark of the “First and Finest Company” – Merchand's band of opportunists – yet the shield had been cleaved in two with a sword sharper than the crest that defended its owner.\n\nAround the Company, I saw tracks, not unlike those I'd seen at the ruins where Grenville's curiosity had led him (how many fools does this land inspire?). The Ancient Keepers had come for Merchand's band, one and all.\n\nThe tree is a thing born of azoth, born of the blue light in the lanterns. And where the dead walk with azoth burning in the orbs in their chest, I fear these men now walk with them.\n\n- Maddie</string>

	<string key="HuntersCabin_Body_01_04">I hunt bison in the area mostly for something to do – they roam thickly here and in Everfall, and the skins fetch a decent price in Windsward for those unwilling to do the labor. I've not had the same aversion to cold as other settlers – hunting near the mountains is peaceful to me. I had a small base camp at the mountain to the north along the trails but past this expedition I found little game as it went deeper into the snows and mountains than before.\n\nIt was there I came across the first bison corpse – killed by wolves it seemed at a glance, but upon inspection I saw that the wounds the bison bore were marks of teeth and claws much bigger than any wolf I had ever seen. Inspecting the corpse more carefully, I discovered the bison's mouth to be covered in ice, as if its breath had frozen before it was torn apart. The icy tracks of the assailant led into the northern mountains.\n\n- Renée Marie Cartier</string>

	<string key="HuntersCabin_Body_01_05">The tracks of the creature that killed the bison were that of a wolf – but not a pack of wolves, a single wolf. Yet, based on the snow, much heavier than any wolf – and embedded in the tracks were small, snapped twigs, and in one, what seemed to be part of a tree root, covered in the same frost as marked the bison's wounds.\n\nI consider myself no coward, but this isle's mysteries frighten me, for I do not know what the snows hide that stalks in the shape of a wolf and whose tracks are blended with that of the forest – but I do not wish to find out.\n\n- Renée Marie Cartier</string>

	<string key="HuntersCabin_Body_01_06">Yet as the bison seemed to thin in the passes and I became wary of the strange wolf tracks in the mountains, I found myself avoiding the mountain snows and instead, favoring hunts deeper into the woods. \n\nIt was on the hunt today that I first caught sight of the stag – not a stag as familiar to us, but something that seemed grown from the forest and had taken the shape of a stag – I know not how to explain it. Around its horns grew moss, flowers, and its hide was the rich green grass of the forest floor. The sight struck me so I could not move, I could not breathe, until the creature seemed to spot me, then leapt away and vanished into the undergrowth.\n\nNow every silhouette in the forest stands out starkly to me: the animals of the isle are not governed by the seasons, but shaped from them – the earth, the vegetation, even the snow and ice.\n\n- Renée Marie Cartier</string>

I have heard tales of the strange forest creatures there, seemingly woven from the wood itself – a trapper in the local outpost had given the creature a name, a ‘spriggan,' a tree spirit the height of four men, with a body and limbs of branches given life – is this something born of the isle? Or perhaps something created by the azoth in the forest?\n\nThis isle is filled with wonders, and I wish to see them all. May fortune favor me on my journey – a glimpse of such a sprite is all I require, even if I must spend weeks circling the lake.\n\n- Renée Marie Cartier</string>

The man seems struck by the same wanderlust as I, though his seems more in the way of digging up stones and picking at bricks in old ruins. I offered him and his companions shelter for the night, but though his companions seemed to want to rest, he seemed eager to be on his way and kept speaking of a Great Discovery that was within his reach, if his efforts proved true. \n\nHis manner – while not hostile, and I'm certain he meant no rudeness or insult by it – was rather unsettling, and seemed to have an urgency about him – not of one fleeing something, but chasing something. \n\nIn an attempt to calm him, I asked if he still played his piano, and he seemed confused for a moment, as if he had quite forgotten it existed, then shook his head, as if the memory was unwelcome, a distraction. I hope he finds what he seeks, though I fear what he might stir up in the Brightwood if he does not take care to slow his pace.\n\n- Renée Marie Cartier</string>

Behind it all, there was a roar that rose in waves, then faded - and a great frozen light from the great rock that sits in the center of the stone ring. \n\nI fear what I shall find, but I will not wait for the tide to claim me without going to see with my own eyes what has happened. Is this the Great Discovery that Grenville spoke of? If so, I fear it has consumed him – and awoken something in the isle itself.\n\n- Renée Marie Cartier</string>

Her name was Madelaine (Maddy), and insisted I not use the title of Captain when speaking to her, as her arrival on the shore of Aeternum did not deserve the title – nor did the crew she had lost.\n\nGenevieve was suspicious, then upset, and she asked me many questions – about Maddie's presence, to the alchemical equipment, and most of all, the cages, which alarmed her greatly. What manner of beasts were they to hold, she asked?\n\nNot “hold” but what manner of beasts we may SAVE, I replied.

She does not tire, and my cages remain full for my experiments.\n\nMy family does not call me to join them for meals, nor for sleep – I sleep in the workshop now. But the alchemy, it works – the Watchers (the ones willing to still serve as test subjects) report that upon consuming my latest mixture, claim that the Corruption does not eat at them as it used to, and they retain their strength as they venture north! I have passed along the recipe to the Magistrate, and keep records here as well.\n\nI cannot rest on this success, however – I must continue my research. A half-victory is not enough – the formula only slows the affliction, not cures it. We must drive it out completely! And I will be the one to make it happen.\n\n-M. Havelock, Archminister</string>

	<string key="Alchemist_Body_01_07">The “Captain” – Maddie returned empty-handed today. She interrupted me in the workshop and when I saw no new Withered in the pen, I inquired – rather sharply – as to why she was disturbing me.\n\nShe told me she had spoken to my wife, seen the eyes of Simon, and she has taken their side. She tells me she refuses to capture more Withered for my “experiments” – and then the woman had the NERVE to lecture me, ME, that I have become too narrow of purpose on the Corrupted, that (and I got quite angry at this) my attempts have begun to erode my common sense and is causing both me and my family suffering.\n\nI told her I have no need of her services any longer. If she feels my work is done, then her work is done as well, and there is no reason for us to speak again. She left without a word – good riddance, I say.\n\n-M.H.</string>

	<string key="Alchemist_Body_01_08">In my haste to dismiss Maddie, I remember my cages now lie empty.\n\nI need one - or two - more specimens. It is no trouble, I have observed Maddie's techniques enough that I may capture my own. The Withered are little more than animals – sick animals, but animals to be sure.\n\nI know where some can be found. Though dusk is close, I shall set out at once.\n\n-M.H.</string>

	<string key="Alchemist_Body_01_09">It is a near thing, but the cages have two more captives – though it is strange – for these Withered bear the markings of the settlement to the south – can these been the settlers there? They smell of a strange sort of rot… sickly sweet, much like if the scents of a corpse and a flower were mixed.\n\nI wonder why they wandered so far – my efforts are more important than ever if the Corruption is making its way this far south. I cannot help but notice now they are caged, these Withered are more eager to return to what might have once been their homes, and they claw at the pen with an unusual strength.\n\nWell, I will not allow it – the only thing they shall find is the mercy of my scalpel and the salvation of my curatives. If should they perish like the others, then when they arise, I shall test them again!\n\nTo work!\n\n-M.H.</string>

I made an error in my methods… my family has paid the price.\n\nBoth Withered I had caught died upon the table. Yet… and I see my mistake now… when I had taken the second Withered from the pen, I did not lock the gate – and when they rose again hours later, they found the cage unlocked.\n\nThen, they found Genevieve. They found Simon.\n\nThe first beast was still skulking outside the house – all I could see was red. I planted a hatchet in its skull, and it turned to ash. The second one soon followed… but as their corpses vanished, the corpses of my wife, my son… they remained.</string>

	<string key="Alchemist_Body_01_11">I finished burying them this morning.\n\nI forgot to say farewell, but I do not think I will – we no longer talked in life, there is no need to do so now they are dead. I think they wanted to leave the isle, leave this place… leave me… so completely, that the isle honored their wishes and let them sleep.\n\nAfterward… I returned here, to the workshop, to put down my thoughts while they were clear in my mind.\n\nI failed them, yes. But they did not die by my hands, and I will not fail others. No other family will be lost to the Corrupted. All we sought on this isle shall not be lost with them.\n\nThis tragedy has only renewed my purpose. I shall bring every Withered beneath the knife, see them exposed to every formula, and I shall see their sickness driven from them. Then, the isle shall know peace. I shall know peace.\n\n-M.H.</string>

The Withered seem to know my approach, but do not run – as if it is simply the cycle of the day. At times, it seems like they are welcoming me – as if someone familiar, as if family.\n\n-M.H.</string>

I will not suffer the Corruption, but in so doing, I have ended my own life, I feel it. My blood seems to flow to unfelt corners of my body, and I can feel the rupturing of every blood vessels – and I can see my eyes bleeding red in my reflection in the Lake's waters, and I have no idea how I crawled to the lakeshore… or if I am imagining it.\n\nI will not surrender. This is my home. This is where my family died. I shall NOT die here with them.\n\nMy work will live on. I will live on.</string>

	<string key="TwinFalls_Body_01_01">Finally, our travels across the Cleave has yielded fruit! We have come upon a stretch of land, fertile and rich, secluded enough that one may hear their own thoughts from the yammering and chopping of wood and clanging of hammer to metal in the settlements to the south. And the waterfalls nearby, such a sight to behold!\n\nThe traders of the outposts warned us of the dangers of the Cleave, but I see now they sought to keep us from the unblemished land – here is where we will make our mark, found a claim, and build our homes. We have seen little else but bear tracks in the area, and while numerous, we have not seen their owners since our arrival.\n\nI must ask: Why has such a stretch lain untouched for so long?\n\nWhy, it must have been awaiting us - and we are thankful for nature's gift. We shall unload the wagons and put the timber within to good use!\n\n-Ealderman Wincroft</string>

	<string key="TwinFalls_Body_01_02">The beauty of the area is astounding. Everything grows so quickly in the earth, and so much so that the gardens are to bursting – azoth blesses this place, the vegetation especially.\n\nIt grows so thickly, in fact, the men have taken to shifts to trimming away the excess vegetation on the houses and fences, yet it seems to grow back with every dawn, thicker than before. While the Adler Boys frequently complain of the chore, they did make mention of something I had not noticed before – they said the greenery seemed to grow thickest from the homes fashioned with the Wyrdwood timber we had carried with us from the West.

	<string key="TwinFalls_Body_01_03">The Adler Boys, gossipers and layabouts, have been causing trouble, even though I've tried to put their idle hands to use trimming the vegetation back. The two made light that we need not need to fear the bears in the woods – we have no need to bolt our doors at night, for the grass and vine that beset our homes would do it for us.\n\nMay the bears take them both if they don't mind their tongues.\n\n-Ealderman Wincroft</string>

	<string key="TwinFalls_Body_01_04">Troubles plague us! Not from the land, nor the construction, but the animals, who have grown overbold at our intrusion. While we saw signs of bears and wolves in our journey here, we encountered nothing – yet now that we are making a home in this place, bears have been sighted in increasing numbers at the edge of our settlement.\n\nWe keep the doors secured, food out of reach, yet their numbers seem to grow with each passing day. I have sent the Adler Boys (they are the swiftest of us, since we lost the horses) to run for the local outpost for more powder and perhaps to hire some hunters – we shall make short work of these beasts. This is our home, not theirs, and if they persist, they shall see we have claws as well.\n\n-Ealderman Wincroft</string>

It is as if nature itself is seeking to drive us away.\n\nShould things in the village become too much, I may seek shelter in the shack up the river, though I would not want to be trapped there should the bears roam that far, there is little place left to flee.\n\n-Ealderman Wincroft</string>

I confess my cowardice – I ran , ran here, but even the falls could not drown out the cries of the other villagers as the beasts fell upon them.\n\nI fear no help will come. I no longer hold out hope for the Adler Boys' return: I pray they kept running, and they lead no one else to this False Paradise. A green death that surrounds us, and if we do not keep our wits about us, it shall harvest us, not the other way around.\n\nLight fades, and I see great shapes circling the flimsy walls of this shack. I shall keep quiet and hope nothing comes - but I know this hope to be a lie.\n\n-Ealderman Wincroft</string>

	<string key="GreatBridge_Body_01_01">Even though we have suffered much, and the Bridge has been taken from us, I still carry hope that one day we will be able to drive the Corrupted from its ramparts.\n\nI still recall the wonder when I first set eyes upon the bridge that crossed the Great Cleave. If there was every proof of the architectural skill of those who came before – the bridge quelled all doubts. It is a feat of engineering, something that could be said to rival the wonders of Europe and the East - if only others could see it.\n\nI've surveyed the bridge, both when I arrived, and from a distance later on – it is with great sadness we had to say farewell, to retreat, but I and the other settlers… it was too dangerous to remain within its shadow.\n\n-D. Prieto, Queensport Engineer</string>
	<string key="GreatBridge_Title_01_02">The Survey</string>
	<string key="GreatBridge_Subtitle_01_02">02 Subtitle</string>
	<string key="GreatBridge_Body_01_02">The Bridge seems a continuation of the Ancient roads that cut the isle. The massive pillars that support it suggest it was built to carry heavy cargo, most likely the great stone blocks that compose the Ancient ruins – for we discovered a temple on the Eastern side, complete with the great statues seen elsewhere on the isle. \n\nThe temple is not safe to explore, however: Wolves, seemingly of frost (!), stalk amongst the standing skeletons of the temple – yet I do not know which is worse, the wolves or the skeletons: the skeletons seem to watch us silently, their bone and armor perfectly preserved, spears in their hands of bone. Perhaps they once Bridge guards in times past. Now? They guard it in death.\n\nAs with the other Ancient structures I've surveyed, the Bridge seems a cross of mortared stones and pillars of rock that seemed to be shaped seamlessly from a single, great block of stone. How the Ancients constructed such marvels is a mystery – either they had armies of laborers, or, especially in the case of the uncut stone, perhaps a means of shaping the mountains and the canyons to their will, perhaps using the power of the Isle itself? \n\nWe may never know their mysteries, and with the Corrupted and the other creatures now atop the Bridge, we may never be able to uncover its secrets – if we survive at all.\n\n-D.

	<string key="GreatBridge_Subtitle_01_03">03 Subtitle</string>
	<string key="GreatBridge_Body_01_03">We underestimated them – we assumed the Corrupted cunning, yes, but in the back of our minds, we considered them our lessers, barely capable of speech, and still clinging to the garments of settlers of old. We saw them as nothing more than the same shells we had seen to the South – the Withered we eagerly cut down as we harvested what we could from the isle.\n\nThis arrogance has cost us the Cleave. \n\nThe Corrupted used the winter against us – as they always have, I now see. They don't feel the cold stabbing at them, it does not slow their march. And worse, the day they fell upon the Great Bridge, they proved capable of not just cunning, but tactics: they used a winter flurry to mask their approach on both roads leading to the Bridge, and even if the watch had time to call out, their voices were lost in the storm. The Corrupted then set upon the remaining soldiers – but none of them did they cut down. Instead they pinned them, shackled them, and carried them away – where? To the North, perhaps. If so, they did not remain there long – within a season, they had returned, the sight of which nearly broke us as we caught sight of our lost men and women upon the Bridge, side by side with the Corrupted.\n\n-D.

	<string key="GreatBridge_Subtitle_01_04">04 Subtitle</string>
	<string key="GreatBridge_Body_01_04">The sight of them is like a knife to the heart. Losing the Bridge was a blow to our morale, but what occurred not soon after nearly pushed us to retreat from the Cleave entirely.\n\nThe entire season, the Corrupted still commanded the Bridge, but as the season ended, they were joined by others – and among their number, we saw our own brothers and sisters. They were standing guard as they had before, but this time, they stood not against the Corrupted – but with them. \n\nI still watch from afar, a single spyglass to pierce the storm. And when I raise the spyglass to see what lies there upon the Bridge, I see their commander, staring back at me, her eyes like two burning coals in the hollow of her face.\n\n-D.

I would have passed this off to rumors and wild tales…\n\n…had not the Bridge been touched by the same madness.\n\nI was watching through the spyglass when I saw the first of the Corrupted struck down, its head split from its shoulders – at first, I thought it was only by imagining, perhaps spurred by hope – but no, there was fighting upon the Bridge, another group perhaps, but it was certain – they were attacking the Corrupted!\n\nI sought another vantage point, but the sight gave me hope – I moved swiftly so I could see the battle play out, but this may be the turning point in our efforts!\n\n-D.

	<string key="GreatBridge_Subtitle_01_06">06 Subtitle</string>
	<string key="GreatBridge_Body_01_06">At first I thought the fighting on the Bridge was perhaps a counterattack by another company, or a drunken dare by Merchand and his thugs (who have long boasted they could take the Bridge in their undergarments) – it was neither.\n\nMy heart froze colder than the surrounding frost as I saw skeletons, spheres of blue light burning in their chest, slowly marching the span of the Bridge – and when the Corrupted launched themselves at the attackers, the Ancient Keepers did not fall back but met them head-on: the Corrupted were ruthlessly cut down, their remains cast from the Bridge as they dissolved into ash, leaving only their weapons to fall to the stones below – in moments, the Ancient Keepers had taken half the Bridge, seemingly uncaring of the numbers of the Corrupted.\n\nI see now it was fortunate we had not staged the same assault, for the Corrupted had been prepared – for us, perhaps, but not this. In response to this unexpected attack, reinforcements swarmed the Bridge like ants, Corrupted erupting from hidden places in the surrounding rocks to drive back the Guardians – but to no avail.\n\nWhen the sun fell, the Bridge had once again changed hands – and the Corrupted were no longer its master. The blue fire in the chests of the Guardians lit the top of the Bridge now, marking it as their own.\n\n-D. Prieto, Engineer</string>

	<string key="TideBattle_Body_01_01">Even the snows fight us. It slows our march, and sinks its fangs into us, as if hungry to drain our warmth. It is a friend and ally to the Corrupted - the Corrupted use it as cover, hide in it, and strike without warning – we are only flesh, and while the isle may grant many of us a rebirth (or curse us), it does nothing to drive the cold from us. \n\nFrostbite has claimed many of us, and some of us have not the fingers to hold weapons, nor the strength to walk where the cold has eaten at their feet and toes. Several of us do not believe the Cleave is worth holding at this price, and many more believe that we have already lost to the Corrupted and the elements.\n\nStill, we march. Still, we fight. I fear if we do not hold the Cleave, and we withdraw to warmer climes, we will be surrendering the heart of the isle to the Corrupted.\n\nYet we continue to fight, one and all.</string>

	<string key="TideBattle_Subtitle_01_02">02 Subtitle</string>
	<string key="TideBattle_Body_01_02">The Bridge exposes us to the harshest wind, and many of us seek shelter behind the stone blocks. The watchmen at the bridge's end are not so fortunate – they must stare into the whipping wind and keep their eyes open to the threat of an attack – whether the frost wolves to the east, who are growing in number, or the incursions of Corrupted to the North. They must keep their eyes open, even when their lids are in danger of freezing solid.\n\nThe two Wathers draw straws to see who mans the East edge of the Bridge. For as terrible as an attack by the Corrupted might be, the shadow of the ancient temple there and the way the wolves seem drawn to it is unsettling, and adds further burden to a Watcher's heart.</string>

	<string key="TideBattle_Body_01_03">The Watchers on the western edge of the Bridge has reported of a new development – he claims to see silhouettes moving in the snows, out of gunshot and arrow range, moving in such small numbers as to be a waste of a target to our siege engines. Yet, he sees a few of these shapes a day – and there is no hint of their destination.\n\n“I fear they are hiding in plain sight, digging beneath the snow,” one Watcher muttered by the fire. “If they were there, we wouldn't know it until their blades were at our throat.”\n\nThe other Watcher laughed, but without humor. “That would be a mercy, to be free from this hell.”\n\nThere are other hells, I thought. Earlier in the season, I had seen what had happened to one of our band of scouts, walking with the Corrupted, marching in pace with them – not as slaves, but as the Corrupted themselves. There are other hells - the cold is but one of them, and far from the worst.</string>

	<string key="TideBattle_Body_01_04">Soldiers are deserting. The gloom that consumed Wickbury was a blow to everyone, as was the sightings of what seemed to be priests leading the Corrupted. We were not fighting an army – we were fighting a crusade from the North. The loss of the Bridge only added to our woes, and many saw little to hold onto. “We cannot stop a tide that has already filled our flanks and now rises before us upon the Bridge. The battle will not be won here, we must retreat to Brightwood.”\n\nThe talk grows in the camps. In the times when we were united in purpose, any such talk would earn lashes – cruel, but perhaps necessary. But then again, that may be why the alliance fell. Hearts may harden across many deaths, until you feel little at all. After that, there lies little difference between the Corrupted and the soldiers.\n\nIf we do not fight the Corrupted, they will consume us. If we fight the Corrupted, they will consume us. Either way, the spirit is tested, and it can only be tested so far before it breaks.\n\n\n-L.G., Acting Captain</string>

	<string key="TideBattle_Body_01_05">One of Rutherford's scouts returned – he was one of the ones who had drunk the Brightlake concoction, the one that gave strength to the spirit, and lessened the poison of the lands north of the Cleave. He had suffered, true, but he came to us in right mind, and – to our amazement – smiling.\n\n“They're not just what we once were,” he said. “They're still like us. I've seen beyond the fortifications – they have farms. Towns. Even what might be a church, at the summit of the mountain!”\n\nThe men mumbled their surprise, but I was the first to speak in anger – I held my tongue, to give the man some moments of peace to enjoy his return, but his words angered me beyond all reason. I shall walk, collect my thoughts – this fool of a scout, he does not know the truth in what he saw.\n\nIf we have not yet lost this war, the sighting of the church has done so, whether the soldiers realize it or not.\n\n-L.G., Acting Captain</string>

	<string key="TideBattle_Subtitle_01_06">06 Subtitle</string>
	<string key="TideBattle_Body_01_06">Rutherford's scout continued to speak as the night wore on, as if his words were intended to give hope – he prattled on, continuing on about the farms, the structures near the Shattered Mountain – the ‘civilization' in the North. When he spoke again of the church that he had seen, I could take no more.\n\n“You saw a church,” I heard myself say. “Yet the Corrupted have no religion like any we know. You think this means they are to be reasoned with? That peace will be easier? A church only means we have a canyon wider than the Great Cleave between us – not physically, but in spirit. We know they do not seek to kill us. Do you welcome conversion to… to that?!”\n\nI pointed at the crown of the Shattered Mountain, the isle torn from its foundation. “You think you bring words of hope, that we might make peace, but I tell you – in a single structure, you have given us proof that there will be no peace until we are all as they are, and all worship as they do.”\n\nWe are no match for the Corrupted if a twisted religion drives them. I had no patience to speak to the man further – I shall do question him again when I have calmed myself.\n\n-L.G., Acting Captain</string>

	<string key="TideBattle_Body_01_07">The Rutherford scout, ashamed at my harsh words, did not boast further of his discoveries to the north, and the hope left his features. I felt no remorse in his newfound silence, for best he lose hope now and let truth guide his actions.\n\nI interrogated him most thoroughly. He said that yes, he had seen remnants soldiers we had lost in the camps to the North. He had seen many things… not simply the foul church he had seen, brimming with red light, but the labor of the Corrupted, and worse… leaders. The Priests we had seen upon the Bridge were not unique – there were many, all serving whatever twisted religion led them.\n\nWe had already seen what they could do at the Bridge… at the Wickbury. And would likely do so again – to think they numbered more than the three we had seen – it is a dark thought.\n\n-L.G., Acting Captain</string>

	<string key="TideBattle_Subtitle_01_08">08 Subtitle</string>
	<string key="TideBattle_Body_01_08">What almost broke me was when the returning scout spoke of the obelisks. Not the ones we'd seen to the South, not the ones common elsewhere in the isle. He saw others, larger ones, being excavated by the Corrupted. Worse, there were other obelisks already unearthed… but these obelisks, freed from the earth – and the scout paused at this, for I feel the import of his words was at last becoming clear to him – he said these obelisks seemed… alive, floating above cyst-like wells in the landscape – floating stones, like the one atop the mountain, harnessed by the Corrupted and their priests.\n\n“Like they are making a claim,” I prompted. His eyes widened at that, and before he could express his confusion, I cut him off. “Not like ours. Never like ours. A claim that is their own, one that will consume this isle. And in coming here, by adding to their ranks – why we've shown them the way to destroy us.”\n\nWe must fallback to the Brightwood. Others must know of what we've found.\n\n-L.G., Acting Captain</string>

	<string key="TideBattle_Subtitle_01_09">09 Subtitle</string>
	<string key="TideBattle_Body_01_09">We retreated into the forests, conserving our powder. We fell back on familiar trails, careful to strike at the Corrupted and then retreat before more came to its aid. When one of us fell, a soldier would stab a blade through the victim so that they might re-awaken faster and rejoin us at the front. The grudges among the soldiers grow, but in others, it becomes a curious competition, to stave off the most deaths – and for others, to quickly spill the blood of the fallen so they feel as little pain as possible and awaken, still ready to fight.\n\nIt is a field of madness. We fight the Corrupted who have our corrupted brothers and sisters among their number, who, too, seem reborn to fight – we slaughter them as we slaughter our own, all for gaining a few feet of ground, to briefly hold a slice of the Ancients road – to anoint this land and claim its azoth with our blood.\n\nWhen I stare at the Corrupted – the ones who bear tattered shreds of an age of a hundred years ago, or wear a rusted mask of a Conquisitador, I wonder if settlers ages past went through this cycle as well – and the only victory was in the corruption that spreads like the blood upon the snows.</string>

	<string key="TideBattle_Body_01_10">I ran into people from the South, where they still fight over wood and flint and timber – great matters to them, but their words, their actions almost sparked me to anger.\n\nDid they not see who we fought? Did they not see the Withered and the Wraiths and the Corrupted as but the first symptoms of something far more terrible? \n\nTheir eyes are filled with azoth – and in a terrible moment, it reminded me of the fire in the eyes of the Corrupted, the twisted red light that seemed to drive them to violence, that seemed to consume them.\n\nAnd I wondered if perhaps the Corruption and the azoth were both of the same well from which we drew.</string>

	<string key="TwinFalls_Body_02_01">We were making our way east from the Cleave. We might not have noticed the unusual trees had one of the wagons not gotten caught in the mud. While the industrious among us fought to get it to solid footing, we made an unusual discovery – or should I say, the most idle among us made the discovery: the Adler Boys, who have yet to carry their weight beyond gossip and shirking their chores. In this instance, their idleness proved a boon.\n\nThe boys had slipped into the woods and had come upon a strange copse of trees – trees that seemed limmed with a strange blue light, suffusing the wood. We might not have known, had they not returned with branches from the same trees – branches they were using as makeshift swords, not knowing the value of what they held. The boys dubbed it “Wyrdwood” and insisted on keeping their new “swords.”\n\nWe quickly noticed the wood was remarkably lightweight and sturdy, so we set aside the labor with the wagon a moment to search the area. This wood may be worth harvesting – for if we fashioned homes or walls from the wood, such structures might prove remarkably sturdy. Perhaps the wagon being caught in the mud was not a setback after all, but a blessing!\n\n-Ealderman Wincroft</string>

	<string key="TwinFalls_Body_02_02">The Adler Boys led our band to the copse of the blue-limmed trees, the “Wyrdwood,” and the trees looked dense enough to harvest – it was unusually strong for its weight (though it took us fashioning some stronger hatchets to bring the trees down).\n\nThe discovery was a boost to morale – the discovery of the Wyrdwood even made me hesitant to berate the Adlers for straying from the wagons, though they had been warned countless times.\n\nWe set about harvesting what we could, while others got the wagons to dry ground – it seemed fortune favored us, and fortune could be made should we collect enough!\n\n-Ealderman Wincroft</string>

	<string key="TwinFalls_Body_02_03">Our fortune with the Wyrdwood soon turned sour. As we sought more of the trees, it did not take us long to see that the trees neighbored one of the great stone ruins: the same ancient ruins with the preserved corpses, standing at attention, the ones that were said to walk with blue fire in their chests. Fortunately, we spotted the ruins at a safe distance, so we quickly and quietly returned to camp – the lumber had already been loaded, so we were soon on our way.\n\nI consulted my maps of the region, and if there were a tie between the wood and the ruins, it was likely other sources of the Wyrdwood could be found near other ancient sites. I did not wish to test our luck by seeking them out - but perhaps the knowledge could be of use to a merchant.\n\nFor now, we continue our search for a settlement to make our own – our wagons continued along the roads, making their way east: We'll travel to the other edge of the Cleave if need be, but I'll not settle for nesting near ruins or outposts, that much I swear.\n\n-Ealderman Wincroft</string>

Now here we are, and beasts the like of which have never been seen remind me we are strangers to this isle – and the farther north we go, both man and beast alike, become more feral and unapproachable.\n\nThe danger started simply enough – while scouring the track, Dunne caught traces of that glittering rock, the one that glitters like stars lie within. Seeing pieces of the ore lying quite thickly about, we spent days looking for a vein of the stuff and sought to mine it. To be sure, we feared the sound of our pickaxes would wake the Corrupted from the Cleave - but that was not to be our misfortune.\n\nAs we unearthed the “Star Rock” day upon day and piled it upon the wagons for the outpost, we could not help but notice the days grew colder and colder, more sharply each night. We had learned not to stray too far east and south on account of the great bears, but the sudden onset of winter was something we had not expected. Dunne had caught sight of wolves, he claimed, but he said they did not howl, nor move as he had ever seen a wolf move – he said that they looked as if they were rimed with ice, wreathed around like a coat of winter.\n\n-J.

	<string key="Excavation_Body_01_02">I saw one of the strange wolves today. Dunne did as well, though he is not here to speak of it. It was mid-day, and I saw it all play out most clearly.\n\nWe had lifted some of the star ore to the carts, when suddenly, soundless, there was a wolf – a thing shaped as a wolf – at the opening of the mine. It was as if it had just broken free from a glacier, for spikes of ice covered its coat, as if the two were wedded.\n\nI bid my muscles to move, to run, to scream, yet I could do nothing. Dunne was not so fortunate – he issued a cry, as if to drive the thing off, and held a chunk of the starmetal over his head threateningly: as he did, the beast was suddenly upon him, its jaws at his throat. My eyes did not deceive me – I watched as frost blanketed Dunne's throat where the fangs sank into flesh and froze the blood as it jetted from his wound.\n\nI confess I did not stop to aid him – I fled into the mine, hiding there, praying warmth shall return to my bones. If I escape this place, I shall not return, for I am convinced those beasts did not arrive by chance – our working of the ore must have brought them, as if they sought to guard it against those who would take it.\n\nI hereby relinquish my claim to this mine – if others wish it, they must answer to the devils in the ice and make peace with them.\n\n-J.

They appear veritably shaken even now, but they are glad to be alive once again.\n\nOn this island, can we not perish? How brilliant, how mad!

Even Elizabeth, my dear sweet muse, is prompting me to omit the scene of Blythe's beheading- the CLIMAX, of all things! There is only so much complaining I can take!\n\nWe've taken refuge at the Inn in Cleave's Point. The place is full of scoundrels and thieves, but when they heard of our play they were brimming with excitement! If only Alcott and Bancroft understood my work like they do…\n\nThese blithering fools! Do they not respect me enough to give me their all?

Even worse, Blythe's speech has started to slur- and last night she tried to cleave my head from off of my shoulders!\n\nI'm keeping Blythe under lock and key until further notice, as it is clear she is unable to perform. To prevent the spread of her feral nature, I've kept her locked away, far from the others. Elizabeth, to my dismay, was distraught when I informed her that she would play the role instead- but the show must go on! She has not died before thus far, and that will make the beheading even sweeter… Oh joy! What a show this will be! Cleave's Point will be in awe of my brilliance!\n\n-William Eastburn</string>

Every line, brimming with emotion… but when the beheading came, she faltered. She cried out to me, pleaded, but in my brash foolishness I had Bancroft drop the axe. When she dissipated into dust, she did not return… Instead, she sparked with an energy I have never seen before. Her voice screamed out from the heavens what a terrible man I was, and that she would haunt me for eternity. Then, my beloved muse vanished.\n\nAlcott and Bancroft have left me, seizing the opportunity to take flight as I mourned upon the stage. Blythe has now begun to decay, and I fear she may break from her chains at any moment.\n\nEvery night I am tormented by visions of Elizabeth, hanging over my bed to punish me for my transgressions. As the sun sets, I can hear her voice wail from over the walls. Now I only wish for death, but it never comes. Every time I try, I can feel something foul welling up inside of me…\n\nOh, what a fool I was! What an insolent, vain, blithering, insufferable fool. I knew of their pain, and I cared not. What a curse this island is! Blast the fates that brought me here!\n\nIf only I had understood their suffering. If only I had cared.\n\n-William Eastburn</string>

The loss of her brothers at sea the year before was hard enough for her to bear, but the passing of her mother and father has dealt a terrible blow to her spirit. I have not yet informed her of the debts in her father's name, as I am still going through the accounts. To lose what remains of her family and the fortunes within a year… it is a tragedy. \n\nThe debts seem given over heavily to one of the new companies, that of the “Red Sign”. I am unfamiliar with it, but both her father and brothers seemed to have paid quite an expense on their joint enterprise and exploration of the islands around the New World… it is rather confusing in parts, but I am parsing the information piece by piece.\n\nDespite the loss, she has remained strong. Each morning, she goes to the church on the grounds and prays. I have asked the local priest to visit her, and bestow what support he can.\n\n- F</string>

Isabella met the man in his cell alone, and spoke with him for hours before she finally returned. Her eyes were bright, and where the tedium of days had worn upon her, she seem invigorated with new life. \n\nI have seen this look before, and I do not like it. It was the light that burned in her brother's eyes – her father's eyes. Worried, I asked her how the conversation had gone, and she said, the treasure upon the man was not the azoth, but the man himself.\n\nHe was living proof that the fountain of youth existed, and it could grant eternal life to those who found it. The isle of azoth was no legend – it was true.\n\nI asked her what could be gained from such knowledge, and she laughed lightly and replied, “because he says he can take us there.”\n\n- F</string>

I know the servants (those who remain) think I come here to pray… but I come only to listen to my thoughts, to sort through them, one by one so I might make sense of it all.\n\nWe held the services for my brothers here when they were lost at sea last year, and then again for mother and father less than a month ago. I expect even the meager services expended the last of the family “fortune,” which have never recovered from our numerous setbacks. Father proved to be in debt to many companies, and had risked a great deal in his enterprises… and now I am left to bear that burden. I wished I could have traded places with him and my brothers – not in death, but upon the seas, to be far from this place.\n\nNow I simply feel older than my years should allow. It is not grief, it is simply that I lack the compass for where I should go, what I should do – and what I can do. There are not enough years in one's life to do all that I wish to do – or had wished to do, and what status our family had is lost, squandered on fool's errands.\n\nYet in this simple church, I feel at peace, and take comfort in it.\n\nIsabella</string>

I had not exchanged more than a few words with him before, but the words came easily. I told him of the absence I felt of family – the fear of debt. And aside from the looming misfortune, there was the looming presence of age to contend with. My brothers had their lives taken from them by the sea, but mother and father… they deserved more years than they were granted. I told the priest my father had often spoke, quite passionately, of a Fountain of Youth, where he might take back his years and gain enough years to recover from the trials that life brought with it.\n\nThe priest was silent at this, then said, almost apologetically, that we were given this life, a requisite number of years because more… more might cheapen life's beauty. To wish to extend one's life – he seemed quite pained at this – was even considered offensive, heretical by the church. He spoke as if he had heard heretics saying such, which piqued my curiosity. When I pressed him on it, he protested I misread his tone – anyone speaking, let alone claiming to have proof of such nonsense, would be kept under lock and key so their madness might not affect others.\n\nHe knows of someone like this, I am certain of it. I will make inquiries.\n\nIsabella</string>

Isabella has taken his knowledge as if it has lit a fire in her, and it has given her a frightening sense of purpose. I urge her to rest – cautiously – but she will not hear of it. The mere hint of the Fountain of Youth's presence has moved her to action.\n\nThe crown was not so understanding – and Isabella had the misfortune to speak of the source of the fountain. They had been willing to back her request to see the heretical prisoner, but a Fountain of Youth returned a different, more scornful answer. It turned out that she might have tried a different tactic, had she thought of it – but as it happened, her father's debts caused an unexpected result.\n\n- F</string>

Not all of it, to be sure, there's settler blood, too, and the Fen was thick with it - we told him be on his guard or the Fen would drink deep of his blood as well.\n\nIt didn't seem to kill the gleam in his eye, though – he'll see different if we get close to the Corrupted's old fort, and see if he likes wearing boots dyed with blood of the marsh. It's a small blessing that settlers older than us pushed the bastards back to the Cleave, for I doubt we'd have the soldiers to do it today, especially now that the Queensport Union got struck by the Cleave's heel when they got too bold.

Might be poison, as you say. Or it might taste like your pride. Either one might cure that lack of sense of yours.”</string>

Other prayers are more foolish, “the Witch has lived here ages,” they say, “and she survived.” Yet when I ask the same fools to draw a map to her home and how anything or anyone might find it, let alone attack it, they grow quiet and return to their cups.\n\nIf we will not help ourselves, we must find others who will. I have heard tales of a union at Queensport, a collection of companies who have banded together to protect the isle. It will be a hard task to convince those of the Fen to welcome any government or army, but I fear if we wait for the Corrupted to convince us, there will be little left to protect.</string>
	<string key="Weavers_Title_01_06">A Helping Hand</string>
	<string key="Weavers_Subtitle_01_06">This page is undated.</string>
	<string key="Weavers_Body_01_06">A Queensport Officer was in the Fen outpost. I took this opportunity to test his convictions, though in a circular fashion. He answered honestly, even disagreed with me when I claimed the Corrupted in the Fen did not trouble us overmuch.\n\n“I do not want to tell others how to live their lives, but the Corrupted do not let others live – they prey on them, and descend like locusts. Where there is one, you can be sure there are others. It is for this reason we have decided to form the union at Queensport.”\n\nI asked if Queensport might “lower” themselves to help the simple people of the Fen, and he grew even more serious. “We must help each other. Even if I were not of the Queensport union, it is the duty of every living soul on Aeternum. The isle a gift, but that does not mean we must not fight for it.”\n\nThe man's name was Rutherford. I asked if he would speak to the Weaver's Company, and he agreed. What comes of it, I do not know.</string>
	<string key="Weavers_Title_01_07">Nothing from Queensport</string>
	<string key="Weavers_Subtitle_01_07">This page is undated.</string>
	<string key="Weavers_Body_01_07">Rutherford's inquiry fell upon deaf ears. As expected, the Weaver's Company – or their drunk representatives, more like - did not wish to stir up trouble with the Corrupted. “What gain is had in antagonizing them? They do not harm us if we leave them be.”\n\n“Have you seen a brother… a sister… a mother, a wife, among the Corrupted?” Rutherford asked. He was calm, but his tone was sharpest at ‘wife'. “I have. I am certain even in Weaver's Fen you have seen it, fellow countrymen who now walk hunched, their skin shriveled, yet a devil's light in their eyes.” Many of the representatives fell silent at this – yet one became angry. “What of it? They were weak – what little faith they had, failed them.”\n\n“No,” Rutherford responded quietly. “You did.”</string>
	<string key="Weavers_Title_01_08">The Talks</string>
	<string key="Weavers_Subtitle_01_08">This page is undated.</string>
	<string key="Weavers_Body_01_08">The talks persisted, angrily and uselessly. The representatives wanted nothing to do with Queensport, but their arguments bore little reason. Every helping hand, every calm word was slapped away or scorned.\n\n“And what price is your ‘Queensport assistance'?” The representatives demanded of Rutherford. “A tithe? Taxes? All we left the mainland to put behind us?!”\n\n“There is a tax, yes, for maintenance of the roads, to assist in trade… and to assist each other. But most of all, I offer you our swords, our rifles, and our friendship. That is what will keep the Corrupted from the door.”\n\n“You think we cannot protect our own,” the representatives challenged.\n\n“No single company can,” Rutherford replied. “Even us. And that is why I am here now. You are not asking for our help, we are asking for yours.”</string>

The idea I propose is based on their patterns of hoarding! They must have some semblance of the value of these stones and, in a lust to hoard wealth, they put such small stones into the safest place they can muster: their own bodies!\n\nFinding precious gems in the belly of these poor wretches is still rare.

I dream of a day when I can walk the settlement together with him, arm-in-arm, so that everyone might see, even mother and father. For now, though, we exchange coded notes so that none can read what we wish to say to one another.\n\nJennifer Kelleher</string>

	<string key="00_Aeternum_Body_02_01">Today we journey out from the settlement in Everfall to uncover all we can about these beguiling obelisks! I, Roger Henry Stevens, lead this expedition, and am accompanied by two strong associates: Walter McKay and Elias Anders. As leader, I assign myself the task of documenting our journey for posterity, as well as recording all scientific measurements and observations to be gained from this endeavor.\n\nAs draft animals are difficult to come by, our expedition is lightly equipped, bearing only what we may carry on our backs. Our goal is to complete a circumference of the outer obelisks and, if successful, gather a full expedition to penetrate ruins and make a true inspection of the central obelisk. One planned detour is to be made to the Windsward settlement for resupply and respite.\n\nI plan to spend a few days at each obelisk, taking measurements and gathering plant and stone samples from each location, to determine what — if any — differences are present at each. Our first destination is the Orion obelisk, where the journey shall begin.</string>

A pleasant change from these past weeks, having a roof over our head. I shall have to speak with McKay and Anders and ensure we do not relax our guard, even during this respite. I am confident that my idea of leaving collected samples at staged locations is the correct one, given our limited carrying space.\n\nTo note: Samples have been stored at the Hydrus obelisk, while the first bundle of notes were stored at the Draco obelisk. Collect these upon our return.\n\nStructure is almost identical to others found on previous expeditions, save some environmental weathering. This morning, McKay tied off a rope and climbed to the observation platform, with nothing to show for it but a nice view. Stones appear to have been shaped with little or no use of tools, may have been magically crafted. Will continue to investigate area, but plan to move on to Delphinus soon.</string>

Odd, that.\n\nEarlier obelisks in this expedition — Hydrus, Draco, and Orion — housed a number of Guardians that did their best to prevent us from investigating the sites... yet these two seem to be uninhabited. No damage is apparent, no major alteration in construction... though neither has easy access to the upper balcony. Is there something on that level which attracts the Guardians? I shall convince McKay to scale the side to the platform to inspect the area further.\n\nWe shall continue our endeavor, and with luck, will find a clue to help us unlock the mysteries of these obelisks.</string>

She looked away, and it was gone.\nIf the Captain decides to go along with this, I might just try and slip away... see how many others want to tag along. If that doesn't work, maybe I'll have to take matters into my own hands.</string>

	<string key="06_Windsward_Subtitle_07_04">Found in Pride of Puckett</string>
	<string key="06_Windsward_Body_07_04">Not sure I should be writing this, after what happened to Salvatore. The Captain caught wind of a mutiny, from Sal and some others, and Isabella gave him some new ideas on punishment.\nHe took five of them and stuffed them in barrels, then hauled them out past the breakers... as far out as he could get. Cracked a hole in each barrel, then kicked them overboard. From what that Isabella has said, it was far enough out that when they come back, they're likely to be Drowned... which is a fate that no sailor wants. Everyone's scared, not just of her, but of the hold she has on the Captain.\nNow I see why Sal was so desperate to either escape or take over. I only hope I'm not next, after writing this down.</string>
	<string key="04_Everfall_Title_07_03">Guardians' Weapons</string>
	<string key="04_Everfall_Subtitle_07_03">Found in Hercules</string>
	<string key="04_Everfall_Body_07_03">The weapons the Ancient Guardians carry are of a rudimentary level of craftsmanship. Occasionally they can be found with steel armaments but most often it is a low-grade iron with which they fashion their weapons. They seem to lack the capacity for ranged weapons beyond a few commanders carrying javelins for throwing, and are a people who live and die by the sword and mace. Their bony hands can also deal a great amount of damage when raked across skin, so even unarmed Guardians should be considered dangerous.</string>
	<string key="04_Everfall_Title_07_04">Guardians' Resolve</string>
	<string key="04_Everfall_Subtitle_07_04">Found in Ursa</string>
	<string key="04_Everfall_Body_07_04">The Guardians attack all humans who dare trespass on the ruins of the Ancients. While animals are free to come and go, anything that stands on two legs is met with immediate and brutal hostility. Without eyes how do they see what they are attacking? Some of their attacks are sloppy and seemingly blind, so perhaps they rely on the other senses in combat. How they stand and fight without muscles in the first place is still a mystery.</string>
	<string key="04_Everfall_Title_07_05">Reaching Towards the Heavens</string>
	<string key="04_Everfall_Subtitle_07_05">Found in Lacerta</string>
	<string key="04_Everfall_Body_07_05">These lookout towers reach up towards the heavens, perplexing the common observer as to how they were erected in the first place. Was scaffolding used? If so there are no remnants of it, and no external support beams to keep the towers up. To me they seem to have grown directly from the ground like proud stone evergreens, stacked high enough to touch the clouds.</string>
	<string key="04_Everfall_Title_07_06">The Orbs</string>
	<string key="04_Everfall_Subtitle_07_06">Found in Carina</string>
	<string key="04_Everfall_Body_07_06">Even more fascinating than the lookout towers themselves are the massive orbs near the top of them. They look so large it vexes the mind to imagine how the Ancients got them up there. Is their directional positioning significant in any way? The orbs appear to bulge out of only one of the sides of the tower, and look similar to the orbs found around Windsward.</string>
	<string key="04_Everfall_Title_07_07">Syndicate Expulsion</string>
	<string key="04_Everfall_Subtitle_07_07">Found in Draco</string>
	<string key="04_Everfall_Body_07_07">I parted with the Syndicate today.\n\nMore aptly, they parted with me, those arrogant fools, but I was close to leaving them anyway. Their jealousy was bearing down on my back over this Ancient research and I believe they were either plotting to steal it from me or take me out of the picture. Alchemist Olivera seemed regretful to expel me but I surmise this was nothing more than an act. He has always been envious of how I take fate into my own hands and pursue the mysteries of azoth on my own without sharing my research. Why should I share? The Syndicate has never done anything for me beyond send me to my death chasing tokens of their favor.</string>

	<string key="04_Everfall_Subtitle_07_08">Found in Orion</string>
	<string key="04_Everfall_Body_07_08">I can feel the glares from Adjudicator Amano and Commander Chauhan whenever I pass them in the settlement. They are not subtle people. I know they disprove of my research into the Ancients, thinking them heretics or weaklings, but I will prove them wrong. I will prove them all wrong.</string>

	<string key="04_Everfall_Subtitle_07_09">Found in Shattered Obelisk</string>
	<string key="04_Everfall_Body_07_09">We all know that the earth is the center of the planets and universe, and it is only fitting that the jewel of our planetary system is the one with such a fantastical island like Aeternum on it. If our planet is the center of the heavens then Aeternum must be the center of the planet, located so closely to the equator and imbued with power as it is. Azoth, the substance found here and nowhere else, is further proof that is the primordial Eden of which the scriptures spoke, the place from which all life sprang. I am honored and humbled to be standing at the center of everything, and must know what the Ancients thought of this phenomenon.</string>

	<string key="04_Everfall_Subtitle_07_10">Found in Shattered Obelisk</string>
	<string key="04_Everfall_Body_07_10">I can feel the toll of the last few deaths especially heavily. My stomach still aches where it was stabbed by the rusty sword of an Ancient Guardian and no amount of healing drops seem to soothe the pain. I am becoming weaker with each resurrection, waning like the moon until there is nothing left. I must put a pause on my research for now, and find someone who can venture out in my name and the name of the astronomical sciences. I shall wait in the settlement for someone of a like mind who can continue my fieldwork.</string>

	<string key="12_MonarchsBluffs_Subtitle_01_08">Found in Farside Township</string>
	<string key="12_MonarchsBluffs_Body_01_08">Some of us have settled in the west side of the valley, naming the farm "Lakeside." We settled opposite of them to the east, naming our township "Farside." The crags and trees shroud that soil in a year-round shade. Though this would be detrimental to some crops, we've found these conditions perfect to grow a healthy rhubarb crop on this island. The Lakeside families shared with the Farside families a technique to hold back the blight: cleansing the tools we use with fire. May it help us survive the horrors of this island.</string>

Lakeside has already fallen, and the red-eyed monsters are swarming on Farside. Those of us that have survived these attacks have decided to make for the settlement to the north in Devil's Quarry. It is the last judgement for us, and the settlement may be our only salvation.</string>

	<string key="06_Windsward_Body_08_01">Bah, no treasure here either! Naught but funny rocks and creaking bones... dunno why we have to be the ones to "explore" these haunted old stones. Most anything of value was taken a long time ago, and what's left ain't worth the effort.\nBut the boss is paying, so we goes where he goes. If he wants to sit on old stones and look at ants, or twigs, or a tiny twist of metal... as long as his coin's good, me and the boys'll stick by him.\nJust hope he don't want us to go make friendly with them pirates.</string>

	<string key="06_Windsward_Subtitle_08_02">Found in Breakwater Bulwark</string>
	<string key="06_Windsward_Body_08_02">I've reached the top of the bluffs, and set a small camp overlooking the breakwater. Windy, but an amazing view, and quite a charming locale — if you forget about the Pirates at the far side of the cove, or the bony undead Guardians that seem hell-bent on keeping interlopers away from any of the Ancients' ruins.\nI was lucky to have found this... whatever it is. A small stone orb, about half a hand wide, with a series of lines and symbols carved along the meridian. Can't be certain, but this may be the language of the Ancients! You would think, with all of these ruins scattered about, there would be more samples of writing to decipher, but... according to local scholars, very few examples have been found. Maybe we just haven't been looking hard enough.\nEither way. My collection will benefit from this find.</string>

	<string key="13_WeaversFen_Body_02_01">As if there isn't enough to worry about on this forsaken island, now the alligators are encroaching upon our humble fishery. I haven't the slightest what could have caused this migration in their hunting patterns, but it might have something to do with the rumored illnesses sweeping in from the west. If the alligators don't have plentiful, healthy food in the waters it only makes sense they would come to where we've baited the swampwater for years. I hide my hound inside now, and refuse to let him into the Fen without my observing. The last thing I need is a confused, resurrected animal on my hands, too.</string>

	<string key="13_WeaversFen_Body_02_02">My suspicions were correct. The fish of the Fen have developed a yellow tinge to them, sickly and paler than I've ever seen them. This must be what poisons the people and drives the alligators towards our fishery. I do not know how much longer we can remain here with our main source of food fallen to disease.</string>

	<string key="13_WeaversFen_Body_03_01">Dear Kemal,\n\nDo you ever wonder about the blue flames in the distance? As Overseer I know you have little time to spend exploring and foraging like the rest of us with your duties to attend to, but do you ever wonder? Or is that too much for your flitting heart to handle? I speak of it fondly, for I know it well. I am putting together an expedition to the ruins of Canopus to the east and wish for you to give this journey your blessing.\n\nYour friend, Yusuf.</string>

	<string key="13_WeaversFen_Body_03_02">Day 16 of the Canopus Expedition has been met with critical failure.\n\nWhile the Ancient Guardians are immune to the contamination that sweeps the Fen, our fleshy bodies are not. We lost three men today and when they came back they were duller, slower in wits. I fear they are withering, and that we will have to leave them behind when it comes time to return to the settlement. I have begun to develop hives on my right arm where it was slashed open by an Ancient Guardian, and fear I am next to die and come back with less than I started with. We are no closer to understanding the blue flames, and instead have one stepped one foot into our graves.\n\nProvidence have mercy on us all.</string>

	<string key="13_WeaversFen_Body_04_01">I am finally finished with the construction of the plank walkways connecting the disjointed Vega Bridge. Hopefully this makes it easier for travelers to come and go down this ancient and hallowed route, and doesn't just benefit the Ancient Guardians.

What a cursed existence, forced to wander the same stretch of stone for all time in defense of a civilization that no longer exists. How were the Ancient Guardians conscripted? Were the Ancients cruel masters or benevolent ones? How I wish these chittering skeletons were chatty, instead of just clacking about their bones.</string>

	<string key="13_WeaversFen_Body_05_01">Those no-good, down-low, rotten fiends from Periville got me again last night. We were betting on which turkey could run the fastest across the tavern and of course the turkey Ma caught was slow as molasses. Told her not to be so rough when catching it, it's not like turkeys can heal their wounds at a campfire like people can. It was flopping and flapping all over, running in circles as the Periville swine took my coin and laughed. I'll get them next time. Next time, I'll catch the turkey myself and slip it a haste potion for good measure.</string>

He's a good man, a good barkeep to let us take drinks out on debt to him, but his patience is wearing thin, I can tell. The last brawl between the Periville boys and us ended in a broken chair and now Flores expects us both to cough up the coin to replace it. Where does he expect us to scrounge up that much? He's a good man, I swear it, but he's growing tired of the fighting.</string>

Morrison had to use his fishing spear to pierce her skull and put her out of her misery. It is odd, for Withered usually do not come this way. My instincts tell me this will not be the last Withered we will see, and that as more lost souls wash up on this island, more will be made into fetid and mindless husks.</string>

They will only know peace for a single beat in the long, long, heartbeat of the isle.\n\nI could leave again, for elsewhere, but there is no where to go, and I do not have the will.\n\nIt is not a sad thing. It is not a helpless thing. The only place I wish to be is here, upon this isle, and I ask it to accept me. I shall sleep and dream of its shores, its waters, and the songs in the Fen.

Dayspring Mills was a bustling village, everyone contributing their work and production to carve out a new life in this land.\nCrops would mature seemingly overnight, animals brought down in the hunt would seemingly repopulate within just a few days... here, in Aeternum, the days of hunger, of famine, of hoarding food to make it through the winter are all long gone.\nWe are the lucky ones.</string>

The bounty of this land means that fewer are required to farm, true, but even more are needed for defending the village. When one is brought down, it vanishes quickly — the island reclaims its own, it seems — but returns within just a short time. We do not have the manpower to encircle the village with a sturdy wall or even a defensive palisade. Their number continue to grow and I fear we will be pushed aside 'fore too long.\nI can only hope the settlement has space enough for us to return, when that day comes.</string>

Probably could've set one up with the bits around here, but his kit is better than anything I could rig together.

But this charcoal can be used right away, so Forellac has been trading their jerked fish in exchange for weights of the charcoal. Since otherwise, we'd be living on hardtack and whatever meats are shipped up from the Encampment, it is a welcome change.\nPlus, the smiths at the south settlement have been taking all the extra to use in their smelting process, so we can keep the rest of our supplies covered.

As he states, knowledge of magnets is present across all of the world, from the earliest Greek and Jewish and Egyptian scholars to far and distant China, with many years of study being dedicated to their effects. Here, in this Terra Aeternum, I may unlock a new path of research.\nMight azoth influence these magnets in some way? Will they redirect the needle to a new North? Will they improve and enhance the capabilities of magnets? Only time, and experimentation will tell.</string>

I seek to discover whether azoth might be the universal aether on which magnets interact, that invisible yet measurable force. Or is azoth a new tool for the aforementioned interaction, granting the bearer a new form of manipulating this aether which was otherwise hidden?\nPerhaps the properties of magnets crafted from Aeternum-mined material are different in their effects.

The silly arguments by the other researchers here stating that the shards were a part of a common eating bowl are absurd, particularly given the other pieces found there: a chipped knife blade, a long metal spike used for the execution, and a metal grate over the firepit that must have been used to preserve the sacrifice after death.\nI have also uncovered crude drawings that may indicate a powerful relic being held here.

I have spent much of my time planning our future, and one thing concerns me: the Corruption to the north, past the Ancient gate. And while some called me a fool to do so, I set forth to see this evil for myself.\nI ventured north of the gate, able to avoid the attentions of the demons long enough to learn what I needed to. But, fate decided to set me on a new path. Climbing through the mountain passes, I slipped and found myself in a ruin of the Ancients. Inside, artifacts and riches filled the cave to the brim, but what drew me in were the murals on the wall. I did not recognize something specific in them at first, but having studied the spiritual paths of many, I should be able to recognize a ritual!\nFrom my loose understanding of the murals, I believe the Ancients had a way of sanctifying areas on the island, explaining why the settlements to the south are protected from attack. These murals showed me how to do the same! This may be the best way to protect my flock, to give them the peace that so many of them deserve.\nI claimed the artifacts in the cave, bringing back as many as I was able to carry, and have matched many to the murals.

I am fighting for control, but I feel it winning. I have given my most trusted follower specific instructions on what to do. Being near the stone lends me strength, but I know it must be consumed in the ritual. This... will be the last time I have control, and I cannot stop the ritual.

But still, they do wish to fight... the conniving Syndicate thinkers, on the other hand, want only to sit and wait and hide, hoping for providence to fall into their laps.</string>

	<string key="06_Windsward_Body_05_04">Scattered almost haphazardly throughout this digsite, the crew and I have found these strange reddish-orange crystal shards. Approximately the size of my palm, give or take, they are light but incredibly strong. It is unclear what they may have been used for, but given the tool marks on the edges, these may have been common to the Ancients. They could have even been decoration on something that has long since been lost to time, or common tools, or have any number of other uses.</string>

Maybe he'll have some kind of charm to keep the evil away from here, or could come out himself and bless the farm. Should get our delivery in tomorrow or the day after, so I'll find out soon enough. Until then, there's more work to do. Just traded with the miners to the south for some of our crop, so now we have crates full of raw ore sitting around... maybe we can trade it in the settlement for some new boots and tools?</string>

We were able to fight them back for now, but it's too late to press on to the settlement tonight, and we'll need the light to see what kind of damage the wagons have taken.\n\nThe differences in these last two trips has been night and day. Our last trip down into Windsward, perfect weather, no problems at all, and even shaved time off by taking a shortcut between two of those strange Corrupted pillars that have started to appear. This trip, however, has been one problem after another! Broken axles, spoiled food, attacks by every blasted creature on the island... it's like we're attracting every bit of bad luck possible. Perhaps we used up whatever luck we had left?\n\nAh well. We're safe enough for now, and on first look, it seems we only lost a bit of the trade goods.

	<string key="11_Mourningdale_Body_08_01">Truths drowned, resting under the surface. Hiding away ancient sins, hiding away ancient curses. I see them. The beings with four arms. I feel myself sinking under the water, my ears only hearing bubbling and sloshing. As I hold my breath, my chest tightens as my strength leaves me. I can't sense what, but something is pulling me under the surface, and soon I shall run out of air.\nAs my mind leaves me, and my body begins to end its thrashing, I feel the waters surge within me. My lungs begin to fill, but oddly enough, it's not a cold wave entering the core of my body. I feel the water permeating my being, penetrating even to my very bones. I feel as if what was in me is driven out, and replaced by the waters. As I break my bondage and rise to the surface, my mind comes back to the world around me.</string>

	<string key="11_Mourningdale_Body_08_02">The rattle of bone, a watchful eye, their humanity removed, their death denied... I see it. I see a giant stone statue being marched, slowly but surely down the path. The same beings, those of four, guide us down the long and mystic road. The giant statue is carved in their image.\nThose who move the statue are trapped in a servitude, unable to deny or disobey; for what has been taken from us cannot be restored, and what has been given to us cannot be returned. I hear them sing songs as they move the massive stone, and the melodies ring in my ears like a bittersweet memory I never had.</string>

The night sky is dotted with stars, and I wonder what is beyond them. Perched on high at the top of Vela, my vision blankets all of Aternum and the watchtowers dot the landscape like spires from the earth.\nBut something is wrong. The energy, it seems to gather into a massive orb, summoning a power I have never seen before. And, at the apex of its growth, it explodes.\nThe obelisk shatters, sending a shockwave all over the island that rocks me to my core. I fall over, and try to fix my vision on the burst of light and energy that reminds. And what I see shocks me.\nFrozen in space, frozen in time, the obelisk stands shattered, but still together. Destroyed, but not. Trapped in a single moment. And that explosion, that shatter, echos in my head.</string>

Like some kind of sorcery, or an ill-omen, the blue flames of the bay turn red. They have come. They corrupt everything they touch, changing the very essence of the beings of this island. The bay is slowly taken over them, and they overpower even those of four. What few guardians are left are pinned to a small part of the bay, and the red eyed monsters begin their work on the lighthouse.\nThose enchanted by the siren's song of Aeternum soon find themselves caught in storms, attacked by spires of dark corruption that send their vessels crashing into the shore. They came seeking a paradise, but all they found was darkness. Those of four have all but left us to die. But we cannot die, they stripped us even of that.</string>

She drags the scraps from the wooden bowl I made her in favor of eating in the corner of the wall enclosure.

Molly did not as much as whimper when I put the leather lead on through the fence. I spoke sweetly to her, told her it was time for a walk, hoping a lack of captivity would bring out her personality. It turns out her personality is evil, and the second she realized she was no longer contained, my dear Molly mauled me, draining me to my last before I woke up in bed again, alone. She ran back North to her true master, I can only imagine.\n\nThere are better ways to make profit on this lush continent than lying with the dogs. On a related note, I now certainly have fleas. Corrupted Fleas, at that. A Corrupted Flea Circus, yes, now that could work...</string>

	<string key="00_Aeternum_Body_05_04">Had Isabella chosen to mention “azoth” more in her conversations with the crown, I suspect the Expedition may have turned out quite differently – and she may not have been our Captain at all.\n\nAs it turns out, the royal family were not the only ones interested in the azoth. The properties of the substance had already sparked rumors throughout the nations, amongst alchemists, and even companies were formed as to how the substance could be replicated – or found. Even if those who heard did not believe the Heretic's tale fully (or even knew of him), the weight of nations putting backing behind such expeditions was enough to scare others into not being left behind.\n\nAnd it seemed the companies might be moving faster than the crown – one, in fact, had already been partnered with Isabella's family, if the ledgers were to be believed. And her father owed them a sizable debt indeed.\n\n- F.</string>

	<string key="00_Aeternum_Body_05_05">It still is a question to me how the companies organized so quickly. The New World was surely one such inspiration, but to those who had landed on the new continent, no source of this “azoth” had yet been found. The only proof lay with a madman and his preaching. Even though the Church had locked him away, I fear that in doing so, it simply gave more credence to his claims.\n\nThe men seemed unconvinced of the truth of this, but they accepted it. They returned to Isabella many times over the coming month, pressing her for details. I thought that perhaps she would want them kept from the grounds, but over time, I realized she was allowing the visits – for the sake of negotiation.\n\n- F.</string>

As expected, it was embedded in red wax, but I felt that the symbol almost expressed the color of crimson in its strange geometry. I could not make sense of it… yet could not tear my eyes away. Isabella, noticing my gaze, said that she had seen the symbol… drawn with who knows what… inscribed on the walls of the Heretic's cell, also in red, but not in wax.\n\n“Azoth is not the isle's true wealth.

I have no idea how she negotiated such a result, or where she received the gold to back the three ships of the expedition… I suspect she concluded the contract with the Red Sign, and the company now moves with a faith in the presence of azoth that matches Isabella's. \n\nThe three vessels of the Expedition – the Santiago, the Santa María de la Consolación, and the San Cristóbal, are to set sail in a matter of months, yet there is still the question of where these vessels are bound.

	<string key="00_Aeternum_Body_05_09">On the day the Expedition set sail, I discovered what Isabella had used in her negotiation. It was shackled below decks of the Santa María de la Consolación – a dirty, hunched man, with a great beard and eyes like embers in the hollows of his face. His wrists and ankles were clapped in irons, though there was nowhere for him to run… lest he sought to plunge over the side and drown, perhaps.\n\nShe had freed the Heretic from his Church cell. This… man… barely human at all, was to be our guide – if I had known, I would never come aboard, and now I fear where the words of this man will take us – to the bottom of the sea, or worse, to hell, I do not know, but it is some place far from God's grace, of that I am certain.\n\nI was to learn later on the Red Sign had sought to extract the knowledge of the isle of azoth from the madman many times, but the only one he said he would show was Isabella… she must be the Captain, he said. Do this, and I shall show you the way to Vitae Aeternum. It is a devil's price, and Isabella has paid it.\n\n- F.</string>

Perhaps they thought he was imprisoned early in the voyage for some crime, but they know not the truth of it. I fear the day they learn he is providing guidance to our efforts. There may be mutiny if they knew whose hands were really steering the ship.\n\n- F.</string>

We seem to circle sections of the ocean, always at Isabella's insistence, but it is almost as if the navigation provided by the Heretic is meant to cost us time, our food stores, and our faith. Our supplies run low, and tempers among the crew have risen. \n\nI suspect the crew would blame Isabella were it not her bouts of sickness… not from the voyage, but the fever that seems to strike when the winds become calm. Father Dante has taken to caring for her during these times. When the storms beset us, she is on deck, with an authority and command that puts the crew to task. The men fear her, and just when it seems treason might overshadow these thoughts, her presence quells their doubts. It is a strange sort of command – she uses not facts, but conviction to cow those around her. Even I fear her.\n\nI have not mentioned my journal, nor the letters I brought from home chronicling our voyage. I have a strange feeling that Isabella would not be pleased with them.\n\n- F.</string>

Once, a storm almost separated us from the Santiago, but Chief Pilot Keyes on the San Cristóbal found her and brought her back to us. I fear that only Keyes' navigation through the storms has saved us… not once, but twice now. \n\nI did not have much opportunity to meet Keyes at port (I took her for a servant, in fact – she is rumored to be from the West Indies, but not a slave, curiously enough) but I pray we do not lose her before we discover we need to turn back, for she is exceptionally gifted… or lucky.

Father Dante speaks of him as a curse, exerting a devilish influence upon the voyage and the Captain.

Whatever has become of it and the San Cristóbal, only God knows their fate – we are fighting for our own lives, and we may not last the night.\n\nYet over the storm, I heard laughing from belowdecks. It was the Heretic, laughing – but at what, I do not know. He has led Isabella to this hell, and we were fools enough to join them.\n\n- F.</string>

	<string key="00_Aeternum_Body_05_15">We are alive! Much of the crew is missing, but Captain Isabella is undeterred – she has been scouring the shores, looking for supplies and organizing the men.\n\nOur ship lies upon the rocks… it is almost as if the rocks themselves rose from below, splintering the ship's hull so that it became a crown. I believe we are stranded here, for I see no means by which the ship could be repaired. This thought chills me, but Isabella does not seem concerned.\n\nAnd I see we are not the only ships to run aground upon this isle – its beaches are covered with the wrecks of previous ships, some familiar… some that seem much older, indeed.\n\nI asked her if we should begin searching for the crews of the Santiago and San Cristóbal, but Isabella did not seem to hear me, insisting that we must explore the isle and learn more of our surroundings – and that we must focus on helping ourselves.\n\nThe Heretic survived. He was waiting for us on the beach, still shackled by the arms and ankles, yet he was smiling, staring about him. Sand was on his brow, his face, and his lips, as if he had touched it to the shore, kissing it as welcome.\n\n- F.</string>

This isle of Vitae Aeternum, for better or worse, is now our home until rescue comes.\n\nCaptain Isabella has not spoken of the other two ships we have lost, and has given no orders to search for them – only survivors from our own ship, as if somehow they might “escape” into the isle. I realize now her concerns lie in that they find something she herself seeks and somehow take it from her. It is disturbing, but gives her purpose.\n\nI recovered my footlocker with the journals and letters, all dry and intact – I confess, I would have felt better had another crate of provisions washes ashore instead, but the writings give me comfort.\n\n- F.</string>

He scoffed at the hunters, the foragers picking at berries, and remarked – rather oddly. “It does not matter. Aeternum, it provides bounty, but one cannot starve to death here. It will not allow it.”\n\nI have grown sick of the man's chattering – every rattle of his chains irritates me. To know that he survived when many of the crew did not… it makes me think there is no justice here except where we make it.\n\n- F.</string>

It worries me, for when the crew return from hunting and scouting the isle, she asks them many questions as if searching them for a trace of a lie.\n\nI have taken to hiding my journal pages. I now know for certain Isabella would not take kindly to reading them, and their existence would not paint the journey and its goals in a favorable light. Although I could burn the records, my hand hesitates… I have recorded all I have seen truly, and I fear if it were destroyed, Captain Isabella's expedition would be hers to recount alone, and it would be far from the truth.\n\n- F.</string>

	<string key="00_Aeternum_Body_08_01">…the wind has died, so I'm taking the time to record my thoughts lest I forget them. Isabella was not our Captain when she first heard the rumor of the “immortal” Heretic. Whether it was from the gossip of priests or alchemists, I do not know, but it seemed ridiculous.\n\nI know the alchemists put little stock in the man's claims of longevity – it was more in the blue vials he had on his person when he was pulled from the Atlantic. “Azoth” is what the man had called the blue fire, and the name took hold. Its properties were mysterious, almost magical, seemingly drawn from an unknown isle in the Atlantic. The alchemists claim azoth could win wars, tame nations… if only one could find its source. It's why we set sail, as unwise as that may have been.\n\nBut Captain Isabella's interests did not seem to lie with the azoth, not entirely. She had been more curious about the man who had been rescued, and wrote a letter to the Church, requesting permission to visit him. At first, the priests refused, but once Isabella insisted again – now with the royal backing behind her, the Church was forced to agree.</string>

She cries out in her sleep, speaking of red-clothed priests, of evil visages… and then calls out for the Heretic, asking strange questions on what he has promised… azoth, the fountain of youth… the location of this mysterious “Vitae Aeternum” where all of these secrets lie.</string>

The crew is already uneasy at our predicament, but others fear what the Captain and her loyalists will do now that we are here. For now, it is easier to go along with her commands than challenge them.\n\nThe Heretic, in a small mercy, has been quiet since our arrival, and seems content to sit and weave rope from hemp on the isle – for what purpose I know not, but if it keeps him occupied and silent, so be it. I have ordered Álvaro and the others on watch to make sure he is secured each night – I do not trust him.\n\nIsabella still has sent no scouts in search of the missing ships and their crews. The Santiago, I am sure, sank beneath the waves, but the San Cristóbal I have more faith in: If anyone could have survived the storms, Keyes would. Perhaps her ship is still intact and can provide a way off this isle.\n\nR. Velazquez</string>

The man has made yards of it, but without purpose, for we have no need of it.\n\nStill, if it occupies his time and as long as his shackles on hand and foot remain fast, then I shall count our blessings that he no longer whispers in our Captain's ear – and I am sure Ruiz is the same. I often think about looping the rope he makes around his own neck and let him quietly choke in his sleep. I know the others feel the same.\n\nÁlvaro</string>

	<string key="00_Aeternum_Body_10_03">The men grow restless, and as much as I think more and more of flight, I still find myself trying to restore some measure of order. I think when I leave, “Captain” Isabella shall not be able to bring these men to heel as she has with her filthy prisoner.\n\nThere was unpleasantness with him today. I awoke to find Álvaro and the men had made a joke of the ropes the Heretic had been weaving from the hemp… they had looped a cord around his wrists and were leading him about, as if on a leash. Even the Heretic was chuckling at the antics, and seemed quite delighted by the attention. The men, however, seemed to be taking cruel sport in leading the man about, so I put an end to it.\n\nWhen it came to removing the rope from the Heretic, he suddenly spoke to Álvaro. “It's your turn to wear it now.” Álvaro laughed, shoved the man – but when the Heretic persisted, he struck the man, saying he would do not such thing. The Heretic looked confused at this and said most oddly, “It won't be your choice.”\n\nThe words angered Álvaro, who kicked his water bowl and what remained of the man's food into the muck, out of reach of where the man was lashed to the tree. I reprimanded him, but not as strongly as perhaps I should – as for the Heretic, I thought to burn the ropes he had made for good measure, but I could not bring myself to do so – the thought of even touching them seemed suddenly abhorrent to me.\n\nR.

LaCuran and others agreed with me. There are almost nine of us in total now. Either we take command from her or we leave in the night and go in search of other signs of life on the isle, but to remain at Isabella's mercy will get us killed, we are certain of it.\n\nÁlvaro</string>

	<string key="00_Aeternum_Body_10_04">My hand is shaking as I write this – I can scarcely believe it. We have been searching for a path to the Guardianes at the insistence of Isabella, but the isle has not been making it easy. Isabella – and strangely, the Heretic – have been accompanying us, as if they want to be the first to reach the Guardianes. I fear Isabella grows more and more frustrated as the isle blocks our progress.\n\nWhat happened the past day, however, has given me new fear of the isle. We were searching for a way south when the Heretic (who tripped on a rock) encountered a path concealed in the brush. We cleared it away, and found our way to a cove – unlike the shore we had departed, the cove had a chill about it, but we thought little of it. Night was approaching, and rather than risk a trek back in the dark, we decided to make camp.\n\nIt was when night fell that we noticed the lights… at first, we thought them perhaps mist, but they had form and a shape about them that resembled that of men – ghosts. Terrified, we fled the camp and were scattered in the forest. I spent the night hidden in a cut in the rock, and when dawn struck, I tried to make out what landmarks I could to find our way back to the camp.\n\nAlong the way, I ran into Captain Isabella and some of the patrol. Three were missing – I had been the fourth, and she lectured me quite angrily about running. I asked about the ghostly shapes we had seen in the dark. She insisted this was why we should remain together and avoid encountering others on the isle. She glanced at the Heretic, who said simply, “sometimes those who die here do not come back in the flesh. Those are of the Santa María, but they did not claw to shore as we did – their spirits are now… adrift. The island is filled with such phantoms.”\n\nThe men grew pale at this. Captain Isabella said we would avoid the area and continue South. The men secretly have given the place a name: Costa de los Ahogados, and they whispered prayers for the crew who had perished there and hoped they would find their way back to God.\n\nR.

	<string key="00_Aeternum_Body_10_05">We came to two great statues on the shore. Isabella seemed angered at the sight of them, and the Heretic barely gave them a glance, as if he had seen many before. They are strange statues… possessing four arms, and cleft down the middle. Yet such a size they are! It must have taken many men to carve such figures, and the work of the craftsmen is fine indeed, for it is hard to see seams where the blocks of the statue were stacked, or even chiselmarks in the stone, if they used such tools. How they managed the spears the figures hold, I do not know, but such skill is impressive.\n\nWe searched the shore for a time – Isabella did seem to find what she sought, though I know not what that might be. Although the men were about to make camp, she told us we would march back that night and not sleep in the shadow of these “idols”. I thought I heard the Heretic chuckle at that, but it might have been my imagining. I long to strangle the man with his own chains.\n\nR. Velazquez</string>

I have betrayed myself, my crew, and worst of all, my Captain.\n\nI am to be executed, I, and eight of the men who also sought to abandon Captain Isabella.

	<string key="00_Aeternum_Body_10_06">The Heretic was the one who suggested the execution, I'm sure of it. Perhaps he suggested it so that the Captain would not waste gunpowder, but no, I think the reason darker than that. The “mutineers” were brought forth. LaCuran was praying, Montes was apologizing to the Captain, begging for forgiveness. The others, including Álvaro, seemed resolved. Among the crew, we were silent, none of us wanted to join the men on their walk. When he realized his fate, Montes broke into tears.\n\nBy now, we'd known the rumor of the isle's power. Whether is was due to the azoth or something else, we did not know but any who died on Aeternum seemed to have some divine chance to return, reborn upon the morrow (perhaps sooner). The ghosts of the bay were proof, we had seen it with our own eyes.\n\nAs ghastly as the scene was, it made me wonder if the execution was perhaps some sort of test of the isle's properties, not merely an execution. I thought again of what the madman had said to Álvaro… and I saw Álvaro realized the same.\n\nR. Velazquez</string>

I thought to free them, as I'm sure did others – but Isabella's patience had already been tested, and there was no telling if she might turn on us as well.\n\nBut the Captain's order did not fill me with relief, it made me uneasy… why the change of heart when she had been so furious with them?\n\nAt dawn, I saw the truth of it.\n\nR.

They had survived the night, had barely slept, but they had fought against their restraints through the night.\n\nThe Captain, before the assembled soldiers, asked the men if they regretted their actions and repented the crime. She went through each in turn. Montes kept interrupting the others, and his apologies came so quick and fast she had to strike him to silence him.\n\nAs each repented, the Captain nodded… and the Heretic nodded, too, in her shadow. He had a feral grin, as if anticipating what was to come.\n\nAnd then the Captain struck out at each each of the men, one by one… Their faces frozen in shock at the suddenness of the attack, until the bodies fell still. Nine crewmen, dead.\n\nI asked if we should cut their restraints, and the Captain said no – and glancing at the Heretic, who nodded. She said they must remain.\n\nR. Velazquez</string>

Aeternum granted them new life, for the Captain to once again snuff out.\n\nYet I knew this was not the Captain's who conceived of this. I thought again of the Heretic, weaving the ropes in his tent, and now knowing the truth of the evil his hands wrought.\n\nHe had known this would happen. He had always known. He had woven some of his evil into those ropes, enough to damn the crewmen they would someday bind.\n\nIf the isle lends its voice to its evil, it is that horrid figure, hunched in the dark. Though leashed like a dog and wearing irons upon his feet, he acts at the isle's behest. He is its servant. As the Captain is his.\n\nR. Velazquez</string>

	<string key="00_Aeternum_Body_10_11">As we neared the lighthouse we saw that its design was strange. Captain Isabella believes it is a beacon that could signal others approaching the shores… it is encouraging to think that she believes we will not be alone. Perhaps if we find a way to light this beacon, we may be found easier by passing ships. The Captain said we would leave that act until we had explored more of the isle for ourselves, and only after we had secured the isle and made our claim clear, then it would serve to guide others to the shore should she allow it.\n\nThat night, the crew (quietly) whispered that perhaps they should make use of this beacon if she would not… what they had seen in Costa de los Ahogados still haunted them, and they had no wish to remain and join the spirits if there might be an escape.\n\nI, too, share their fears. But I do not give voice to my thoughts. When I leave, I shall do so without telling anyone – but I must find a place where the Captain will find it difficult to track me first.\n\nR.

We have found various ancient arms and armor – some unrecognizable, but others were clearly Roman swords and helmets – while another man came across what seemed a Viking shield at the base of one of the caves. Perhaps the statues and the lighthouse were made by these other crews.\n\nI fear, however, all the remains we found are just that: remains. And that these men were cast upon these shores as we were and never escaped.\n\nShall we also rest our helmets and spears here? Will that be all that will remain of our failed expedition?\n\nR.

I do not know what they seek, but I fear it will drive the Captain to do something rash.\n\nI asked about the crates of cargo – they might contain valuables, or even some clues to elsewhere on the isle.

	<string key="00_Aeternum_Body_13_01">We found one of missing crew today, a man by the name of Damas. The man had fallen overboard in the storms but had made it to shore and had made a simple camp in the wilderness – he seemed like he had fended for himself quite well, but he seemed reluctant to follow us back to camp – so much so I feared he might try and run from us. We were forced to bind him and warn him he was to come with us.\n\nWhen we brought him back to camp, some of the crew gave a cheer to welcome him, but became silent when Captain Isabella emerged from her tent – her gaze was fully on the missing crewman, who I now realized, was truly our captive.\n\nIsabella declared him a deserter, and ordered him bound and gagged, awaiting her judgment. Ruiz looked as if he wished to object, but I think he knew it would earn him a place by the deserter if he did.\n\n- Manuel</string>

	<string key="00_Aeternum_Body_13_02">Isabella ordered Damas beaten for desertion. His pleas became screams, and when the beatings stopped, we were ordered to drag him to the great tree and bind him there so he would set an example. “Let him spend the night,” she said. The mutineers had long since vanished, and nine stone-covered mounds had taken their place – Isabella had finally buried them. Perhaps alive.\n\nAfter Damas, Ruiz came to me in the night and said that if we were to find more of our number, we were not to capture them, but instead, warn them. He said that if we found others, they would end up as the one we had found today. I told him that Isabella would surely punish us if we disobeyed, and he hissed at me that we would be punished if we followed her orders as surely as if we disobeyed them.\n\nWhatever she is, she is not our Captain, not any longer – if we do not leave, we shall end up acting as her or else we shall be executed as surely as the others we found were.\n\n- Manuel</string>

	<string key="00_Aeternum_Body_13_03">Ruiz is gone. I fear to say “fled” or “escaped,” and so are the men, but many of us believe it to be true.\n\nCaptain Isabella has demanded a search, pretending that he must have been attacked by one of the beasts that prowl the isle, but I saw it on her face, the tremble of anger in her voice – she knew he had fled, and she was to blame.\n\nRuiz, I hope you have run far from this hell we have been cast into, and I pray to God you find peace far from here where you might live out the rest of your days.\n\n- Manuel</string>

	<string key="00_Aeternum_Body_13_04">It has been three months as we have camped on Desembarco Eterno. This night, however, Isabella has ordered us to prepare to march in the morning – we are to leave the safety of the camp and head North, along the Ancient road the scouts discovered two days ago. It seems a gamble to uproot us all, but the men said that Isabella does not trust leaving men at the camp, not after Ruiz escaped and she fears more desertions – if we all travel together, she may watch over us more closely.\n\nWhatever the truth of it, we are not such fools as to argue with her command.\n\n- Manuel</string>

The Heretic helps her in her efforts, though his counsel has proven to our detriment, and to hers, I suspect.\n\nIn the morning, we march for the North. I for one, am glad to leave Nine-Man Knoll. I cannot bear that place, for I am angry at myself for those who were punished, yet still am relieved I was not a tenth man to join them.\n\n- Manuel</string>

	<string key="00_Aeternum_Body_13_06">The Ancient road has taken us to the borders of a great marsh. Part of me wonders if Ruiz fled here, and I make a vow to myself that should I see him, I shall make no move to capture him – he has earned his peace, and I do not wish him to suffer as we have.\n\nThe marsh stretches out in many directions, but scouts have spotted a peak in the distance. Captain Isabella has ordered us to march for it, and plans to use it to see more of the land and decide our next destination.\n\nAnd so we march. This fen is a foul place, not nearly as inviting or warm as the shores to the south. Yet the Captain orders, and so we follow.\n\n- Manuel</string>

	<string key="00_Aeternum_Body_09_02">We survived, although the San Cristóbal has not. The storm was fierce, perhaps the fiercest I have ever encountered, but the strength of our crew got us through… and perhaps God answered our prayers as well.\n\nThere is no trace of Isabella's ship, the Santa María, or the Santiago, and while I fear they may be lost, I refuse to give up hope – I will send crew out to search for them as soon as we are able: our fellow crew are our first priority. I know Captain Isabella would do the same, and if she is searching for us as much as we are searching for them, it will not be long before we are reunited.\n\nFor now, we are making camp, and we shall see what tomorrow brings.\n\nChief Pilot Keyes of the San Cristóbal</string>

	<string key="00_Aeternum_Body_09_03">The scouts have found no sign of Captain Isabella, the Santa María, or the Santiago. I said words to the crew that we should not give up hope, nor should we abandon the search. The Captain would not leave us behind and would not stop looking for us if our positions were reversed.\n\nWe have seen about doing what we could to repair our damaged sails. I have set some of the crew to the task on an isle they've dubbed “Stitcher's Ease,” taunting the men there that patching the sails is easy work (though far from it). The stitchers on the Ease have taken it all in good humor, however, and despite our predicament, the crew's spirits are high. The isle is beautiful, hunting is plentiful, and we have begun to craft spears and even bows to supplement our rifles.\n\nI think we have come to a paradise, were we not trapped here. But I have faith in the crew, as they have faith in me. I think of what Isabella would do, and I shall not let them down.\n\nChief Pilot Keyes of the San Cristóbal</string>

	<string key="00_Aeternum_Subtitle_09_04">Pilot Keyes' Journal</string>
	<string key="00_Aeternum_Body_09_04">We have set up a small fortification, dubbed “Consolation”. While the animals on the isle are quite large and aggressive, the walls provide some shelter during the night. Our hunting parties are organized so we take care not to exhaust each area, nor provoke the wolves or bears unduly if we can find hunting easier elsewhere. The crew upon Stitcher's Ease have taken to fashioning fishing poles for the crew, and what we do not hunt in the forests and marsh, we can draw fish from the waters of the isle itself.\n\nThe crew's spirits remain high – while some of them spoke of fears of not being able to return home, those fears are rarely voiced now. The beauty of Aeternum is hard to ignore, and life on its shores… when you respect the isle… is not hard on the crew, and there is plenty of space for all. Some of the crew have asked if they might set up homes or claim parts of land for themselves, and so we have spaced out plots for those who wish to build homes of their own.\n\nThe crew treats me as their governor, even though I do not care for the title. I suspect that is why they trust me with it.\n\nChief Pilot Keyes of the San Cristóbal</string>

	<string key="00_Aeternum_Body_09_05">One of the crew who was part of the party sent in search of the other ships I overheard to say something odd – and I inquired about it with the crew left behind.\n\nThe man had said something on Captain Isabella's character, and said that they would be worse off if she was found. It seems that even though the men search for her, some had a dim view of her efforts before the voyage. One claimed that she had made unhealthy alliances, even gone against the will of the Church by freeing one of its prisoners.\n\nI gathered the men at this, and without identifying the ones who spoke, I spoke highly of Captain Isabella, and reminded them again that if she were stranded upon the isle, she would let nothing stand in the way of searching for us – her first goal would to be reunite with us and work together to find a way off the isle. I reminded them that her ship may have survived, but many of the crew shook their heads at that.\n\n“Her ship was at the devil's mercy before it set sail,” one said. “It's said she had him belowdecks, and it was his guidance that led to their deaths.”\n\nI had no answer to this, because I know of who the man spoke of, for I had seen him. A filthy prisoner, and I could not understand why Isabella had brought him on the voyage. I did not like the ways his eyes darted about, nor the way she seemed to focus on his every word, no matter how strange it sounded… as if she was hearing something else whenever he spoke, something we could not understand.\n\nChief Pilot Keyes of the San Cristóbal</string>

	<string key="00_Aeternum_Body_09_06">A light from a fire has been spotted upon Weaver's Peak. It is not from one of our crew, perhaps it is someone else who lives upon the isle. We marked the position of the fire, and began to set up an expedition to head there the next day to make contact – to think, we may not be alone on Aeternum's shores!\n\nChief Pilot Keyes of the San Cristóbal</string>

	<string key="00_Aeternum_Body_09_07">What should have been a joyous reunion has unsettled me. The fire on Weaver's Peak was not anyone native to Aeternum – it was Captain Isabella and her crew. At first, our crew gave cheers and eagerly greeted our missing shipmates… but soon, the mood became hostile. Captain Isabella demanded to know where we had been, the location of our ship, and where we had been on the isle. These questions were not unusual, but the tone she spoke of them was more akin to an accusation.\n\nI asked her what had become of her ship, and the Santiago, but she confessed she knew nothing of the Santiago and had not sought it out… and I realized she had not sought our ship out, either. I took in the health and disposition of her crew, and that made me even more uncomfortable. Many looked gaunt, starved, and were exhausted from what must have been a march of many days with little rest… but their expressions told of greater unpleasantness. Even old friends among the crew seemed unwilling to speak to us.\n\nIt seems few of Isabella's crew survived to reach Aeternum's shores. We have offered to share our bounty and food with them, for I realize we have had better success with hunting than it seems they have had.\n\nChief Pilot Keyes of the San Cristóbal</string>

He seemed terrified of what Isabella would do should she found out… and so I agreed, meeting him with a few men from my crew in case the man meant some harm.\n\nThe tales he told were almost impossible to believe. He listed the men Isabella had executed, and how the crew remained, not out of loyalty, but out of fear of what would happen if Isabella caught them should they try to escape. I said surely he was exaggerating, and he said no, and then recounted the punishments that Isabella had delivered upon the crew she perceived as traitors.\n\nHe then asked if he might join us, and that if we agreed, he would slip away with us tonight. I told him I had not planned on leaving, but inviting Isabella with us – along with the whole crew. He grew frightened at this and warned that we should leave at once and that we were in danger the longer we stayed.\n\nChief Pilot Keyes of the San Cristóbal</string>

The crew man was convinced the man was a curse, that he had been responsible for the ills that beset the voyage. I pressed him on this, and said the man had been a guide… and had led us to Aeternum at Isabella's request.\n\n“Aye,” the man replied. “I think he knew the way here, but he didn't mean for all of us. He's been here before, that much is true. But he didn't lead us here for azoth or gold or even to help us…  he brought us here for some other cause, and there was no grace in his act.”\n\nChief Pilot Keyes of the San Cristóbal</string>

After her crewman's disturbing tale, I resolved not to come to any decision without speaking to Isabella first. I found his tale difficult to stomach, but the sincerity and fear in his words were hard for me to ignore.\n\nAs it turned out, I would not get the chance to speak to her. I heard the screams at first – moving quickly in case we had been attacked, I found her in front of a roaring fire… and the crewman who had spoke to me was upon the blaze, screaming. Isabella was shouting at her crew encircling the blaze, that the man was disloyal, that he cared only for himself… he sought to split from the Expedition… and the next words chilled me, for then she added, as the “crew of the San Cristóbal had done, and sought to leave us behind.”\n\nShe had gone truly, completely mad – and I knew then, she meant to harm us for she saw us not as fellow crew, but as traitors, all.\n\nChief Pilot Keyes of the San Cristóbal</string>

If there was any doubt, the isle grants life to those who perish… and Isabella uses it like a weapon, hurling the crew against our walls knowing they shall soon be under her command again. It is vile, evil… what drove her to this?\n\nOnly our knowledge of the Fen has kept her at bay – she does not know the marsh as we do, nor how to avoid the animals and other dangers of the swamp.

Our days are spent fighting or preparing to fight… we set ambushes, build Forts, and the Fen becomes choked with the wreckage of our battles. It has been months, and there has been no victories on either side… for every inch of ground Isabella gains, she loses it on the morrow. She seems to have thrown patience and caution to the winds, casting aside strategy and negotiations for the hope of a quick victory. Why is she so determined and quick to act?\n\nShe refuses all my attempts to speak to her. I no longer have any name to her other than “traitor”.\n\nSeveral of her crew have fled to my side. They say while they fear her, they fear what will happen if they stand with her. Many of the crew wept when they found themselves safe at Consolation, and the few tales I have heard before are nothing compared to the tales of what Isabella now does to drive the men forward… I do not think she cares for me, she cares for what I might find on the isle.

He has somehow placed himself in a position of command, and Isabella treats his words as scripture. I fear he delights… or is at least amused by this conflict, even though he is in chains. The fool has become the king. I do not know what unearthly power he has brought to bear over Isabella, but if she is to be freed, if she is to hear reason, then I must find a way to seize him and if necessary, kill him.

	<string key="00_Aeternum_Body_09_14">Isabella has vanished with her filthy advisor. After the bloody fighting upon the ridge, it seems she abandoned her remaining crew to be slaughtered – using their deaths to mask her departure. We moved upon her camp where she had slept the night, but found no trace of her, no tracks marking her passing. Five men of her crew are unaccounted for, including the Heretic… we suspect they left with her.\n\nWe did find the Heretic's leg irons – when she left, he accompanied her, of that I am sure. I have sent scouts out to find their trail. I do not believe she headed south, however – she came north along the Ancient road in search of something, and did not expect to find us. Even with all the blood and death, we were nothing more than a distraction for whatever consumed her.\n\nWherever she and the Heretic walk now, I do not think God walks with them. I think they walk toward something else, and I do not know if we will see them again.\n\nWe have pardoned what men remain. Some have refused our offers, and they have fled, or still attack us, still blindly following their Captain's last command. I fear there is little we can do for them – but I hold out hope they will understand that we are friends, and that we should act as allies, not enemies upon this paradise that we have stained with our blood and our hate.\n\nChief Pilot Keyes of the San Cristóbal</string>

I can no longer waste strength on Keyes and her traitors of the San Cristóbal – I must find the strength that was promised, secure it, then the traitorous among her crew and mine shall answer for it.\n\nThe Heretic has guided us to a great canyon in the earth, the Ancient road spanned by an Ancient bridge – I do not know who fashioned it, and the Heretic himself does not answer. I think he knows, but he does not wish to say, as if it is unimportant.\n\nI ask where he leads us, and if he truly knows where the Fountain of Youth lies. He simply nods and asks for my patience. The road is still long, and we have far to travel. I do not know if our provisions will last. The Heretic does not seem to care… and he does not seem to hunger or thirst.\n\nI often see red at the corners of my eyes… crimson hues crossing the face of my men like the colors of dusk, but in the middle of the day… and even in the firelight.

At times, I think I remind him out loud, though the wind swallows my words, he still seems to hear and nod, as if agreeing that yes, I hold the key to his fate.\n\nIsabella</string>

Many have made this pilgrimage, the Heretic is but one of them. Or… I laugh… perhaps he has led thousands here, one at a time, to the Fountain and its wonders.\n\nAs I laugh, I notice he is laughing, too, his eyes red and dark. He shares my amusement, as if he knows what I am thinking.\n\nAnother of our band has perished. He did not awake as we began our march for the day, and his neck was bent, as if something twisted about it and constricted. If I saw blood upon the Heretic's shackles, I did not remember it. We need him now, or else we shall be trapped forever in this frozen hell. He does not guide… he leads us.\n\nIsabella</string>

Before us looms the great mountain, and the Heretic… it seems strange to call him that after all the truth he has shown us… promises us… promises me, for there is no one left, we have left everyone upon the trail behind us. There were three ships of us once, and the promise of a new world – and all its wonders.\n\nThey are intended for me. Fortune restored. Youth restored. The Heretic says we are close now. The base of the mountain, and we shall be there. I ask him what we shall find. He says such power that Aeternum itself… even the crown of the mountain itself… shall be lifted from its foundations, and all who come to the shores and beyond shall feel the power of it.\n\nI do not know where the others have gone.

The Heretic has asked me what slows my pace, and I told him that… and it has been so long… I wish I could merely stop a moment. Stop and pray that this path was the right one.\n\nPrayer is strange to me. It brings memories. Of a simple stone chapel… across the grounds, in the shelter of trees. In a place that was once home.\n\nThe Heretic seems to share the memory, for he smiles. The Heretic… that is not truly his name, though… surely, once a priest, but he has spoken truth.

But the solid ground, it will not serve.\n\nI feel loss at these words. I did not realize how much I needed to stop. How much I needed the silence, the feel of walls around me. The end to the crunch of shale and ice beneath my feet. And now I see… bone.\n\nYou must build a church, he says. It need not be a great thing… it must only be holy in your eyes. There, you may speak prayers, and know the truth of what you seek.\n\nMy hand is already gripping the first stone around me. It will be the first stone at the Church's wall. There are many stones around me, and I can mount each in turn, one atop the other.\n\nThe Heretic does not help me. I realize now he is watching because his hands are shackled. I shall release him. He is not my prisoner. A prophet, perhaps. Perhaps more.\n\nWhen the last stone is in place, he says, the way to the Fountain will be granted. You will feel all Aeternum course through you.\n\nYou will live forever in this place, Isabella.\n\nBut when he speaks my name, it is in a language I do not know. It sounds like a blessing.

If he had passed that way, he had come alone – Isabella had not returned with him.\n\nI wept at this, and I raged at this. And I feared most of all, he had walked to the nearest shore, then into the waves and cast himself once more upon the seas, to be found by a passing crew, who he would promise all the wonders of Aeternum if only they would follow his words wherever they might leave – and that he had been doing the same to others for a long, long time.\n\nWe shall stand watch against those who come, if the isle permits it, even if it should be a hundred years.

Long serpents lay down to form the rivers, while mountains were made by great leviathans hunkering down to rest. Even the air we breathe in was first breathed out by the dragons. Their gift of fire is the most obvious elemental connection of all. Dragons are all around us; one only has to know where to look.\n\nIt seems the great Taiying Empress' desire to see dragons allows her to conjure them with this strange new power she has acquired.

They beat him bloody and dragged him to the crude cells we had only just erected yesterday. He is to be held there without food or water for as long as she deems necessary.\n\nI'm very lucky that the Empress didn't see me nodding, or I fear I'd be dying of thirst in a cell, too.\n\nI would expect this behavior of the treacherous Shang Wu, but now even our beloved Empress has become hard and warlike.

	<string key="04_Everfall_Body_16_01">Some might ask: what is the difference between fishing in the Old World and Aeternum?\n\nWell, first of all the fish are more abundant here in Aeternum for the island's regenerative properties. Two to more than twenty fishers can be in the same spot and still find gainful fishing.\n\nSecondly, the fish here have an incredible amount of biodiversity. Fish found in salt waters around the world can be found here, and the same applies to fresh water fish.\n\nFinally, fishing in Aeternum is different because it's just more exciting! Setting up a cast and hearing the bushes behind you rustle with the movement of an animal... Ah, the adrenaline rush is unmatched on this dangerous island.\n\nThis would make a good introduction for my fishing book.</string>

Some fish hide away until the moon is out, and they have the cover of darkness. It's not impossible for these fish to be seen when the sun is up but some fish prefer the cloak of night.</string>

I know better than that.\n\nThe pole is important, yes, and a superior one can be engineered in any settlement with the proper station upgrades, but it's not everything. True fishing comes from the heart. I was born with a fishing rod in my hands and while I've preferred some over others the size and rarity of fish that I catch come more from a successfully-aimed cast than an expensively-crafted pole. The crafted poles will last you longer and get you higher quality fish though, I'll give you that.</string>

Hotspots are places in the water teeming with fish, and you'll get better and better at recognizing them as you develop your sense for fishing. The trick to it is landing your bobber within the Hotspot and then you can reap the benefits of whatever rarer fish are toiling there. You can exhaust these spots, so don't be surprised if it disappears after you and other adventurers plunder it for its fish.</string>

The mercury content of the Aeternum swordfish seems irregularly high, but I cannot compare it to an Old World fish without returning home, which is impossible with the storms that haunt the coast.\n\nFor now I must rely on anecdotal evidence from the other alchemists who have seen Old World swordfish, as unreliable as those observations can be.\n\n-Park</string>

These people have not the coin for a house but still manage to live safely at the Inn and within the walls of the settlement, far away from the dangers of the swamp outside.\n\nIt is for these people that I fish, that I bring in my hauls and pass them out amongst the crowds.

Molding Withered and crumbling skeletons leave pieces of themselves in the water they cross to rot, and the ships that crashed here on this side of the island must have been carrying some kind of disease, because the fish are severely affected.\n\nWith a combination of oil spills, undead body parts, and general debris in the water of Weaver's Fen I have my work cut out for me, but I will stop at nothing to see these waters clear and blue for the first time.</string>

But if you were to weigh our hearts, they would all have the same lightness when it came to fishing. Some fish for the food to feed others, some fish for bragging rights, and some like me fish because it's the most thrilling thing on Aeternum.\n\nThe battle one is locked in when reeling in a fish is a hard-fought one on both ends, and coming out of that victorious will never cease to amuse and amaze me. Grand Master Fisher Machera has reigned as our leader long enough. My secret desire is to out-fish him and everyone else, and take the title for myself. Now that would be truly thrilling.</string>

	<string key="15_RestlessShore_Body_08_02">I fished up the most curious thing the other day. It was an oar, one from a rowboat that might have been attached to one of the larger ships that crashed here. When I held the splintering wood up to the light I had an idea: why not use this as a weapon? I only killed a few rabbits on Rabbit Island with it before I angered the Harekeeper's wraith, but overall not a bad run for a piece of wood. I think I shall keep this oar, and use it to hit things far away from me.</string>

I keep her, the pole I mean, in excellent repair and try my best not to die when I carry her with me. She has seen the walk from the settlement to my fishing spots more times than I can count, my constant companion both steadfast and true.\n\nMother withered long ago, but her last gift to me was the fishing pole she'd used to 'catch' father in the Old World. The bond between my parents was an unbreakable one, forged in fishing. When mother and I came to Aeternum after father's death she was never the same, losing herself death after death. She put herself in dangerous situations on purpose, and died more often than I could save her. Now she babbles nonsense and has joined the ranks of the withered. All I have left of my parents is this pole, and I treat it well.\n\nI suppose you wouldn't care about this though, would you Davies? No, I don't think I shall send this letter.</string>

I wear my late father's, though they are a size too big and often fill with rainwater around my ankles. No craftsperson in Aeternum could ever match the Old World stitching on these, and when I close my eyes it is as if father is with me. I fish in silence, guarded by memories and protected by my parents' last gifts to me.</string>

I can't read it myself, but Magistrate Ragsdale has made strides in that endeavor.\nSecondly, I've located an artifact that I believe I can free, but the Guardians of this place seem patently against that. Even just shifting the rocks near it draws their attention, but I've gotten close enough to get an idea of its size. Unwieldy, but nothing I haven't dealt with before.\nAnd finally... a working Ancient device! I've no idea what it does, but it is tucked away on the lower level. When I touched it, flames erupted from the device and I was barely able to escape before a crowd of those Guardians approached. It seemed to draw them away from the upper level... perhaps I can use this.</string>

	<string key="05_Reekwater_Body_02_04">We uncovered a device today, and writings nearby, that is both terrible and exciting. If my translation is correct, the Ancients had control over powers far beyond what we could ever imagine: the soul itself. This device supposedly has the ability to shape and manipulate the soul, even stealing it from the living! What would happen to a person if their soul were ripped away, leaving only the savage husk behind? We have seen those mindless, shambling creatures across the island... perhaps this explains their plight.\nI do not believe that this device was intended to be a weapon, however deadly it might be. There are gaps in the tablets we've found, but I think this device could have been used as a restorative of some kind, wrapping the soul in azoth, to heal or to grant great power.\nIf it were stronger, I would destroy this device before it could ever be used again... but more must be learned about it before that decision is made.\nD.

	<string key="05_Reekwater_Body_07_01">Some of our fisherfolk found an architect stumbling along the surf, and brought him back to the village. Seems he's just arrived to the island. Poor him.\nBut just speaking with him for a short time, I believe he'll be a valuable asset. He hadn't been in the village for more than an hour before he was making measurements and asking questions of everyone he came across. He was already making plans on how to haul those massive stone blocks to the water, kept talking about about creating a "New Venezia" here in Aeternum, a city rising above the swamps.\nWish we had more people like him, willing to get to work right away.</string>

	<string key="05_Reekwater_Body_07_02">Sails were spotted up the coast today, and they came ashore to make contact. Seems they were part of a small fleet, and were driven off course into the storm wall. Only a couple of their vessels survived, badly damaged.\nWe've offered to help however we can in repairing their ships, and restoring their supplies. They don't even know where they are... it isn't often that I get the chance to see that surprised look on someone's face when I tell their captain about this place.\nOnce we evaluate the damage, we can bring the crew to the village here and let them get their land legs back. Not much true sailing to be had around the island, after all. They aren't going anywhere.</string>

	<string key="05_Reekwater_Body_07_03">Taking the time to make a record of this, in case something happens and no one is around to speak for us. This "Siren" and her crew claimed they would settle down and adapt to life here, after failing to breach the storm wall again... but they knew! They knew all along! One of her crew let it slip while dicing with a few of our villagers, and told them that this island was their destination all along.\nBut I saw the shock on her face when I told her that no one leaves Aeternum, that no one has made it through the storm wall. After that, her crew became more violent, more aggressive. Fights have broken out and they're beginning to show their true colors... no better than mere pirates.\nI fear, however, that if this Siren lied at our first meeting about the state of her crew and the ships with her... perhaps there is more she has lied about. I have told the villagers to pack what they can and prepare to flee west at the first signs of trouble. Some have volunteered to stay and fight, to buy time for others to make their escape. I shall stand alongside them.</string>

	<string key="05_Reekwater_Title_08_01">Underestimated Intelligence</string>
	<string key="05_Reekwater_Subtitle_08_01">A journal, lost by Survivalist Langlais</string>
	<string key="05_Reekwater_Body_08_01">Many across Aeternum believe those we call "Dryads" to be no more intelligent than an animal in the wild, living by pure instinct. How, then, do they create the weapons with which to defend themselves? They respond with examples of the shrike bird impaling its prey on sharp sticks. But while the shrike may indeed stab its prey on a point, it does not create the tool it uses, only what is found!\nYears of observation of these Dryads has led me to the conclusion that they are far more intelligent than others believe. I've not seen a Dryad create their weapon, but I see that they carry weapons of a variety of sizes and designs. I've never heard a Dryad communicate, but their behavior suggests that they must, in some form unknown to us.</string>
	<string key="05_Reekwater_Title_08_02">The Promenade</string>
	<string key="05_Reekwater_Subtitle_08_02">A journal, lost by Survivalist Langlais</string>
	<string key="05_Reekwater_Body_08_02">The Dryads appear to be nomadic in a way, traveling from distant places to reach these swamps. Most would not be able to tell them apart, but in watching them, I've noted the differences in their composition, and have traced their origins all across the island. This travel seems cyclical in nature, with a new group arriving every few months. Pliny the Elder wrote of elephants, reporting that they would ritually bathe each other to celebrate the new moon. Mayhap this rite is like that of the elephants, guided by a measure unknown to us?\nBut what drives this slow Promenade toward Reekwater? Is it some form of pilgrimage? Or is there something else to it? I've attempted to find evidence that Dryads leave this place to travel elsewhere, and have yet to find any evidence of that. And as Reekwater is not overrun with Dryads in every nook, the only theory remaining is further proof of their level of intelligence: a knowledge of death, and a desire to do so in a designated place.\nBut death holds almost no power here on Aeternum. What, then, is the purpose?</string>

	<string key="05_Reekwater_Subtitle_08_03">A journal, lost by Survivalist Langlais</string>
	<string key="05_Reekwater_Body_08_03">Notably, I have yet to see a Dryad create a structure of any kind. Birds build nests, humans build homes, ants will dig tunnels for shelter... but Dryads do not. Given that they have no organs we can identify, being made of stone and branch and vine, perhaps they have no need. But this does not mean they are unaware of the concept of construction.\nOne construction draws the attention of Dryads more than any other, and these places are where the highest populations can be found: ruins of the Ancients. Their vines twist through the stones, slowly breaking apart that which has weathered time and storm and events unimaginable. Some travelers have even mentioned seeing Dryads use their weapons in an attempt to break the Ancient stones.\nBut why? What motivates this behavior? They do not dismantle our villages, or seek out our hideaways. If they were human, I would propose that they seek to destroy all evidence of the Ancients, much as Scipio Africanus set his torch to Carthage. Events in the past, long before our reckoning, may have caused this enmity. We may never know the full story, but we must seek to find all we can.</string>

It was putting out this cloud around it, smelled like a tannery, and everything nearby looked sickly, too. Once that big Dryad thing showed up, covered in the same muck, we got out of there fast. We were only near it for a few minutes, but I guess that was long enough for us to get sick.\nWon't kill us, I don't think... but I suppose, even if it does, we'll head back to the village and let them know what we found.</string>

Once I'd failed a few times on my own and was ready to ask for help, he was ready to give it.\nI don't know what I might catch down here in the Muskeg, and I know it's a bit dangerous, but I really want to try and impress him.</string>

Whatever she does to you will be less horrible than what she had planned. Perhaps that's some small comfort? I hope so. \n\nI couldn't let her go through with it. I couldn't let her become the monster she wanted to be. \n\nMy final request of you is to distract her until I can escape the island with the box. She will certainly kill you for it, and maybe worse; still, I must ask, for the sake of our long friendship. If that's not enough, for the sake of every living thing in this world. Even now, I fear it is too late for I hear the Heretic's laughter. Hellish echoes that plague my waking thoughts and haunt my nightmares. \n\nI must flee.

The devil is certainly within his right to play tricks on me. Only a madman could think a wooden crucifix capable of saving Isabella's soul. Only a hypocrite could love her.\n\nI had to leave her.

I finally see that the creature that came back is not the woman I loved. \n\nThe truth is, until tonight, I've never done a single thing worthy of reward. Saving your soul was never within my power. The only thing left for me to do was steal it, and save the world from what you've become. \n\nWe will not meet in Heaven. I hope that we never meet again. To spend my life guarding this box…to grow old, to die alone, imagining the hate you feel for me…that will be my reward. \n\n\nGoodbye, my love. \n\n- Dante</string>

How many years has he spent preparing for this final stand? \n\nNow the nightmare is in here with us, roaring rage at the Lost outside. He's tearing down our barricades to get at them. \n\nIt's so hard to think. The singing has started again, rising up from under the ground. Am I asleep, or awake?</string>

The description seems to fit my observations of the creatures that now circle the ruins. The evidence suggests that the Blight is spreading south. \n\nDr. Fawn has hired several hunters to guard the camp perimeter from attack. I've persuaded one of them to collect tissue samples from the creatures for me. We'll see what the microscope reveals about this 'Blight'.</string>

Or is it sap? I have so many questions. \n\nI also took a biopsy of the red, fungal-looking growths that afflicted the creature, presumably as the result of Blight. Unfortunately, the tissue sample ate through the glass slide before analysis could be completed. Curse these magical diseases… \n\nMeanwhile, the lesser stormwall seems to be growing more unstable.

So much valuable research data destroyed… \n\nIt's my understanding that Dr. Fawn, who was killed in the stormwall flare, is now recommending against re-establishing the camp, claiming 'safety concerns'. Not to question my colleague's commitment (or her courage), but aren't a few deaths a small price to pay, to uncover the truth behind this phenomenon? \n\nBut I'll leave that for the ethics panel to decide.</string>

Pour out one last glass for me. \n\nThere are some things about being a Soulwarden that I haven't told you. At first, it was because I wanted you to just go away. But after a while, it was because I was afraid you would. \n\nA Soulwarden never knows when the fall will come. We may last longer than most, but eventually we succumb to one of the two great forces that take every soul on Aeternum: Azoth, or Corruption. And when a Soulwarden falls, they fall hard. They put everyone around them in danger. An old Soulwarden like me lives in fear of that every day. \n\nI can't bear the thought of hurting you, and wrecking what we've built together. I thought of slipping away quietly a dozen times. But I just couldn't bear to leave. That hope you showed me... the courage, and the leadership... that was my weakness. \n\nI never thought I'd be part of something like this again. These last months, rebuilding the Soulwardens, I've been the happiest I can remember ever being. That's how I know it's time for me to go. \n\nSeneca said, "Life, if well lived, is long enough." I've lived more than long enough, and I'm not afraid. I'll go somewhere far away, where I can't hurt anyone, and let Azoth take what's left of my soul. I think I'd make a good Lost, honestly. Maybe I could even haunt a spot with a nice river, for fishing. \n\n\nKeep the Soulwardens safe. \n\nYonas</string>

How little did I know, me true path had yet been revealed. \n\nMe First Mate, family on th' high seas, had raised mutiny. I had no choice. So sadly, had I no choice but to execute the poor soul on sight. Without a sea breeze of a second, I barely thought and fired. \n\nA click. \n\nAn explosion. \n\nThe cool sizzle of th' exhausted barrel. Saw the universe explode before my very eyes! That was the day, I always say, that I became a Master Cannoneer.\n\n -          &lt;i&gt;Master Cannoneer Jennings&lt;/i&gt;</string>

Those who live in the dark can never recognize Paradise.\n\nBut where eyes fail, faith sees. The Covenant carries the Spark. In our time of need, the Spark carries us. Its clarity is our greatest gift. We bring the light of the Spark to the darkest corners. We keep it shining, at any cost, against any foe.

With the microscope came knowledge of invisible life, too small to see, yet all around us. These discoveries didn't change the world, because they have always been true. But they changed us, humankind. We have grown. Knowledge is transformative, creation's most powerful force.\n\nThere is so much we still don't know about Aeternum. Why don't people die? What animates the Lost? Who were the Ancients? We must ask questions to find answers. We have just scratched the surface of the secret depths this place holds. It must be studied and understood, regardless of the cost. And once we understand reality, we can start to improve it.\n\nAll rational beings are welcome in the Syndicate. Join us.

All efforts to domesticate or re-domesticate these animals have led only to injury and a lot of swearing. \n\nTherefore, it's important to transport ONLY as many goods as your own back can bear.

They're my lucky cats, and I thought our bond was unbreakable. \n\nBut the very instant we touched shore on this island, their faces twisted up with hate. Clawed my face into a bloody mess, they did.

Not grazing or walking around. Just standing still, like they were listening to someone. The one closest to me had a bridle on, the leather all rotting away like it was a hundred years old. \n\nI must have made a noise, snapped a twig, like. They turned and looked at me, all at the same time. In the moonlight, I could see the whites of their eyes, shining, rolling, rabid. They opened their mouths and screamed, a sound like no earthly donkey I ever heard. \n\nI ran. Couldn't have run faster if all the devils of hell were chasing. The sound of their hoofbeats followed me through the forest, all the way home. \n\nI can't ever tell my mates about what happened, or they'll laugh me out of town.

As promised, there are ruins here that retain some of the Ancients' power. How we might harness it, however, I haven't a clue, and I don't think we'll be acquiring that knowledge anytime soon. Unfortunately, the bountiful nature of this land seems to have seduced Legatus Maecia to the extent that she has abandoned our cause and turned utterly provincial.\n\nFor years, she justified our ongoing partnership with the residents of the settlement here, but it's become clear to me that she is simply making excuses for us to remain here… indefinitely. Believe it or not, the people here have even elected her to be constable of the settlement, an appointment I regret to say she eagerly accepted.\n\nI have stuck around a few months, uncertain of whether it is my duty to see her punished for dereliction of duty. Even if I were so inclined, however, the locals here would thwart any attempt I made to do so.Rather, I am sending this report to inform you of the situation, and I will instead journey west in the hope of joining up with Legatus Fulvius before he goes to Reekwater.\n\nI trust that either you or the gods themselves will see to it that Maecia is cursed for her betrayal.\n\nLegionnaire Carolis</string>

How could I ever return to the infernal Brimstone desert knowing this was here? I decided then and there that I'd be abandoning the Legion. I just had to wait for Legionnaire Carolis to give up on me, which finally came to pass, thank the gods.\n\nMy affection for the autumn colors hasn't waned to this day, but I do feel like I've become stuck somehow. Like the season itself, I'm in transition, waiting for a winter that will never come. Furthermore, I've started noticing a change in the people here, a hollowness about the eyes.\n\nYesterday, I went out and they all looked like puppets from some traveling mummers show! Then the weight of the sky started bear down on me, like a crushing misery. I just ran back into the town hall, and frankly, I'm now scared to leave.\n\nI know Legionnaire Carolis would say I was cursed for betraying the Legion. I don't know if it's that, or some further stroke of ill luck, but I won't be leaving town hall anytime soon, if I can help it. I just hope the town doesn't turn against me.</string>

But you know that in the decades since we arrived on these accursed shores, my burden has been by far the worse to hers.\n\nIt's damned unnatural for a child to watch a parent remain young as they grow old. Why I'm one of the handful here cursed to continue aging, I will never comprehend. I tried to accept mother's youth, but after she became Constable, it was impossible. Watching her take command with such vigor has only hastened my decay. Even today, I listened as she and Artificer Kim made plans for some bright future. They don't realize how stupid they sound.\n\nWhether we grow old here or not, whether we suffer or thrive, none of us will get the peace of eternal slumber. And without the promise of death, I simply do not see the point in pretending that we are living.\n\nI thank you for your friendship, Albert, but I must now turn my back on First Light and embrace the darkness… whatever that may bring.\n\nAethelgard Oakes</string>

Each year, they've piled higher, and I can no longer sort the truth from the false.\n\nWatching Aethelgard slowly shrivel in body and spirit, I forced myself into the habit of putting on a hopeful smile no matter how I felt inside. Saints know, I tried. For his sake, I risked everything in a desperate bid to escape this island, but as with everything else here, it ended with disappointment.\n\nFor some reason, I still remember the smell of his skin when he was a newborn, but in the years before he left, Aethelgard smelled like a sick, old man. It reached the point where I couldn't even get close to him. I'll never forgive myself for that. I only hope where he is now, he's found some measure of peace.</string>

Was it cowardice that motivated me to abandon the Mines De Miclot to the Lost? Have we let the Lost Pirates on the coast grow too strong for us to ever be able to contain them?\n\nMaybe Dauti is right. I don't know anymore. I've decided to resign as Constable and leave Windsward. I'll visit my cousin in First Light and then return to Ebonscale to see if I can be any use there in strengthening the resistance to the Empress, as I have heard her ambitions have taken a dark turn.\n\nI'll send you this only after I've gone, because I won't allow you to convince me to stay again, and as much as I will miss you, I would ask you not to come after me.\n\nYou must stay in Windsward.

Cowards, the lot of them!\n\nI have yet to share this suspicion with anyone else, but I'm wondering if it isn't something in the fowl. I've heard rumors that sometimes, when people come back to life, they take on the traits of any creatures killed nearby. The turkeys may actually be affecting the populace! I swear I saw a turkey feather in Korrapati's hair the other day. When I looked again, it was gone. And honestly, the whole settlement smells like turkey!\n\nI know what they'd say if I tried to tell them. 'That Dauti, such an imagination when he's in his cups', they'd say. Changying used to say it all the time. What's a Constable got to do to get some respect around here?\n\nI'll say this much, if Windward becomes threatened by the Lost or the Corrupted, we're going to need help, from strangers, from other settlements, wherever we can get it.\n\nFor the moment, at least, I'm headed back to the tavern for a glass of ale and a laugh, but no more goddamned turkey legs for me.\n\nDauti</string>

The crimson of Corruption terrifies me. In my chambers, I hear my Empress weeping, lamenting her tie to this unnatural power.\n\nI know doubts plague her mind.

	<string key="09_FirstLight_Body_14_03">“Tis better to be Lost on land than Withered at sea.”\n\nI heard a local fisherman say this today. His fellows nodded in agreement. I believe this is a reference to the ghost ship that blessed few have seen. I have spent hours scanning the far horizon but have never caught so much as a glimpse.\n\nWhen I tried to question the fisherman, he simply muttered: “Our lives are here now. Nothing else is real.” A surprisingly profound observation, to be sure. I wonder who this fisherman was in the Old World.\n\nZachariah the Scrivener</string>

	<string key="09_FirstLight_Body_15_02">I have witnessed a miracle. While fishing for bluegills near Clearwater Bend, a horde of Withered descended upon us. We retreated into the water, having no other escape. The relentless Withered pursued and I feared we were doomed to join their ranks.\n\nThen the sea pulled back. We found ourselves surrounded by flopping fish. We heard a mighty roar before the sea crashed upon us. The waves pulled me under, tearing my breath from my body. My sight darkened…\n\nI awoke on the beach, surrounded by my stunned companions. Of the Withered, there was no sign. The beach had been cleansed. All that remained was the cries of gulls and the gentle murmur of the surf.\n\nCaliban</string>

	<string key="09_FirstLight_Body_15_03">I have heard a few coastal fisherfolk refer to something they call the “Mother of the Deep.” Aeternum, like other lands of this world, has its own unique folklore. Such tales are common, especially among seafaring people. But here, it is no easy feat to separate myth from reality.\n                                                                                                    \nThis entity is also sometimes known as Lady Fathom. Like Poseidon, Lir, or Njord of the Old World, her realm is the sea, and she is offered gifts in exchange for pleasant weather and bountiful fishing. It is said she is benevolent and protects those who call upon her.\n\nI wonder if such an entity could truly exist. I suppose there is no reason to doubt it. Not here, anyway. But thus far, I have discovered no reason to believe such stories either. It remains a mystery.\n\nZachariah the Scrivener</string>

Living in Everfall means, for whatever reason, that the food begins to lose its succor.\n\nNow when I eat a potato grown from an Everfall field I recoil, disturbed by the bland yet acrid flavor on my tongue.

The denizens of Everfall Hamlet must choose between hunger pangs or a crop of bountiful food that soon turns to naught but ash in your mouth.\n\nThings were not always this way, but in Aeternum nothing is guaranteed. On the Night of the Blue Flames the azoth released made for immense crop growth, with its eventual tastelessness like a punishment for meddling with the Shattered Obelisk. The Obelisk can never be repaired, not by human hands, so Everfall must live with this cursed bounty.\n\nBeware.\n\n-The Everfall Leadership</string>

It was the explosion of the Obelisk that awoke these old warriors, igniting blue flames around the island that cannot be extinguished by water or any natural means.\n\nWas there some sort of timer device?

It shone in and pressed itself upon me, stirring me from sleep entirely. When I approached the window the massive obelisk in the center of the towers was destroyed, chunks of rock floating in the air as if suspended by wires in a stage show.\n\nI know not what this means for the future of the settlement or the island, but I am sure this marks a new era with horrors yet untold.

Blue flames went up all over the island I hear from the Magistrate of Weaver’s Fen who sent a runner this morning to report on the phenomenon.\n\nMy suspicion is that whatever happened to the Obelisk triggered a mass revival event for the bones we all ignored in our exploring.

	<string key="06_Windsward_Body_15_01">My kingdom for a crone’s tinctures to cure this demoniacal sneezing!\n\nYet and still, it is impossible to maintain a sour countenance in this verdant wonder. I was even able to barter for a new inkhorn and quills.\n\nCome to think on it, literacy and letter writing are surprisingly common on this strange island. I suppose that is logical. We have nothing but time, why not learn letters from a fellow. In a closed system like this, literacy spreads. Language as pathogen, though a most delightful contagion, I dare say.\n\nArriving in town, I found a proper place to wash the road dust from my throat. My smiling fancy occasioned me to whistle. Instantly, a gnarled oak of a man stood at my side, saying, “Enjoy your drink stranger, but best not be whistling, singing, nor dancing.”\n\nAt first, I thought myself the butt of some provincial jest. How positively Calvinistic! However, given the graveness of his continence and immense size of his oaken knuckles, I thought it politic to acquiesce. Everyone in the room was merry enough, but there was no music or singing. Conversation was kept to a low murmur.\n\n-Ichabod Shaw</string>

I desire to piece together the folktales and culture bubbling in the unique pot of this island.\n\nTo that end, I found the man with the oaken knuckles – his name is Zadok – and I plied him with libations and many games of draughts. Though his words slurred by the time he opened up to me, his pickled tongue hinted at intriguing tidbits indeed.\n\nHe spoke of a dancing plague, a contagious compulsion to gyrate night and day. He spoke of a spreading pandemic and people dancing until literal death.\n\nHe fell asleep before divulging more. What a delightfully bizarre notion. A dancing plague!\n\n-Ichabod Shaw</string>

	<string key="06_Windsward_Body_15_03">In the sober light of day, Zadok is much more tight-lipped. He sent me away with only the vaguest of grumblings. Later in the evening, I repeated my stratagem of carousing, but with diminishing returns. Filled to the brim, I stepped outside to pass water. Suddenly, a great ogre of a man accosted me in an alley, backing me up against a wall. His breath reeked of spirits and wormwood. I thought the brute was about to offer me personal violence.\n\nInstead, he whispered, “Have you heard His music? Have you seen the Emerald King?”\n\nBefore I could do anything but stammer, the giant lumbered off towards the woods, with a giggle that sounded too childish for his titanic frame.\n\n-Ichabod Shaw</string>

	<string key="06_Windsward_Body_15_04">Days of interviewing the locals and dozens more games of draughts with Zadok have reaped some reward. This Dancing Plague, if it happened at all, happened long ago. Time is a tricky thing to track here. The details vary from mouth to mouth. All agree that a great many died. Some even suggest their exhausted bodies died permanently.\n\nSome think the plague a punishment. These fertile lands saw endless war and strife by those who wished to control it. It is thought the land eventually had enough.\n\nThis is all connected to a very loose myth cycle of a figure known as the King in Emerald, also called the Verdant Death and the Music that Eats. Opinions vary whether this is meant to be an actual entity or simply the madness of the dancing given allegorical form, a shape seen in the delirious ecstasy.\n\nOnly a portion of the community believe in any of this, and they think we should enjoy the bounty of the land very quietly.\n\n-Ichabod Shaw</string>

Their faces betrayed absolutely no awareness of their surroundings, even when I shouted to them. I gather that he and other believers moved the dancers away from the populace, to avoid contagion.\n\nI tried to approach the dancers, but he stopped me with a vice grip on my arm. He told me of a book he once saw, written entirely on the subject of the King in Emerald. He only said this to lure me away from the dancers. It worked.\n\n-Ichabod Shaw</string>

Those who fancy themselves hardened make excuses to stay in and have another round. But we brave few venture out.\n\nYou know the spot, the Goblin Run. At the witch’s hour, we sprint from one clearing to the next, a flight through thorny forest between. If we’re fast enough, we make it to the other side. If we’re lucky enough, we might catch a glimpse of the Horned One. One of us never comes out the other side.\n\nThe gang and I will be there. Your presence earns you a better name. Your absence proves your cowardice. Remember, you don’t have to be the fastest, you just can’t be the slowest.\n\n-Zal</string>

They always need more furs up north, and there is a lady who is willing to pay top dollar for 'em! \n\nNo more hunting expeditions ranging up and down the coast, we'll never have to leave our camp. \n\nWe've got the cats, and a good location.

Good question. We soon found out. \n\nSome crazy lady who believes animals shouldn't be hunted! Who believes that? \n\nSaid we better stop what we were doing and move along, or there'd be real problems. \n\nI told her it was too late. We weren't leaving, we had a good thing going here! \n\nThat's when told us what she did to Reynard. Pushing him into the lynx den.

We've been flooding the local wolf den with hormones. Making them more violent. \n\nThey were already getting that way from having to compete with the lynx for food, but now they are a real menace. \n\nThey are so dangerous, people pay us to kill them. So we get paid twice, once for their deaths, and then again with their furs. \n\nWait, I hear something outside. Is it the snarl of a wolf? Did Caryn lure one here? \n\nForgive me, my love, but I have to check.\n\n\n I hope this letter makes it to you someday if I do not return. \n\n~Your Dearest Geoff</string>

Their weapons are brittle, their armor inferior, and their skill at arms laughable. We will have little trouble claiming these lands from the men who hold them. \n\nThe Crimson Sickness still persists, however, and the restless shades of the dead exist in vast numbers. Myrddin’s secrets must be found and secured if we are to meet these challenges effectively. The Lord Commander assures me we are close to discovering the old sorcerer’s lair. Kari’s wisdom has been most beneficial in this regard. \n\nSoon we shall be reunited, my beloved. I long to hold you in my arms and feel your warm breath on my face. We shall have a new home here.

If after interrogation the prisoner has revealed nothing, they are to be immediately executed and their bodies burned. \n\nThese measures may seem cruel but the urgency of our task demands no less. There will be peace once we have fulfilled the wishes of our Great Lord. It is He who dispenses mercy, He who heals and unites. \n\nWe are Varikulaki and we obey His will in all things. \n\nSir Rulav</string>

With all we're collecting, think we'll need to up the cost to stay in one of our little safehouses... maybe we could even charge azoth! Wouldn't that be something! Few years time, we'll need to start finding places to stash away all that profit!\nHeading to the caverns tomorrow, going to rest for a while. Strange... nobody's around, but I hear voices. Whispers. Must be the wind through the cliffs.\n\n...\n\nDamned creatures almost took my foot off! Patched myself up, but I'll be stuck here a bit.
