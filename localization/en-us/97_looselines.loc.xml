	<string key="97_CinematicIntro_Russo_02" speaker="Father Russo" gender="M" VO="97_CinematicIntro_Russo_02">The island is indeed a place of legend. There is power, and surely riches as well. But many have sought to claim them, and vanished without a trace.</string>
	<string key="97_CinematicIntro_Russo_03" speaker="Father Russo" gender="M" VO="97_CinematicIntro_Russo_03">As we drew near, I sensed an unnatural darkness. A madness overcame the crew. What I witnessed was beyond any evil the world has ever known. How I survived… I do not know.</string>
	<string key="97_CinematicIntro_Russo_04" speaker="Father Russo" gender="M" VO="97_CinematicIntro_Russo_04">The contents of this box are not of this world. They will guide you to that one. Wherever and whatever it is.</string>
	<string key="97_CinematicIntro_Russo_05" speaker="Father Russo" gender="M" VO="97_CinematicIntro_Russo_05">Go then, Captain. Chart your course and your fate. I wish you Godspeed. I will say a prayer for the souls of your crew.</string>
	<string key="97_CinematicIntro_Russo_02alt" speaker="Father Russo" gender="M" VO="97_CinematicIntro_Russo_02alt">The island is indeed a place of legend. There is power, and vast riches as well. But many who’ve sought to claim them have simply vanished without a trace.</string>
	<string key="97_CinematicIntro_Russo_03alt" speaker="Father Russo" gender="M" VO="97_CinematicIntro_Russo_03alt">I was there - I saw the horrors, the madness that overcame the crew. It was beyond any evil the world has ever known. How I survived… I do not know.</string>
	<string key="97_CinematicIntro_Russo_06" speaker="Father Russo" gender="M" VO="97_CinematicIntro_Russo_06">The stories you’ve heard... they don’t tell the whole truth.</string>
	<string key="97_CinematicIntro_Russo_07" speaker="Father Russo" gender="M" VO="97_CinematicIntro_Russo_07">The island is indeed the place of legend. There is power, and vast riches as well. But those who’ve gone before you have simply vanished, never heard from again.</string>
	<string key="97_CinematicIntro_Russo_08" speaker="Father Russo" gender="M" VO="97_CinematicIntro_Russo_08">I saw the horror--the madness that overcame the crew. It was beyond any evil the world has ever known. How I survived… I do not know.</string>

	<string key="97_CinematicIntro_Russo_12" speaker="Father Russo" gender="M" VO="97_CinematicIntro_Russo_12">The island is the source of all legends. There is power beyond your wildest dreams, and vast riches as well. One must simply sail into those pristine waters and claim them.</string>
	<string key="97_CinematicIntro_Russo_13" speaker="Father Russo" gender="M" VO="97_CinematicIntro_Russo_13">I saw it all first-hand… the welcoming shores, the tropical weather. The crew was awestruck—we found paradise.  I only returned to carry the message.</string>
	<string key="97_CinematicIntro_Russo_14" speaker="Father Russo" gender="M" VO="97_CinematicIntro_Russo_14">This box contains just a fraction of the magic from that world… it will guide you there and give you the strength to ensure your success.</string>

	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Thorpe_05" speaker="Captain Thorpe" gender="M" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Thorpe_05">You would have been better off dying at sea!</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Thorpe_06" speaker="Captain Thorpe" gender="M" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Thorpe_06">You can't possibly match the strength Corruption has given me.</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Thorpe_07" speaker="Captain Thorpe" gender="M" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Thorpe_07">Give in to Corruption! It's the only way to keep your soul!</string>

	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Thorpe_13" speaker="Captain Thorpe" gender="M" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Thorpe_13">NO! Not… again!</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Thorpe_14" speaker="Captain Thorpe" gender="M" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Thorpe_14">This will be the last time we meet.</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Thorpe_15" speaker="Captain Thorpe" gender="M" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Thorpe_15">I now serve the Tempest… most willingly.</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Thorpe_16" speaker="Captain Thorpe" gender="M" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Thorpe_16">You cannot possibly challenge us now.</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Thorpe_17" speaker="Captain Thorpe" gender="M" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Thorpe_17">She sent me… to destroy you!</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Thorpe_18" speaker="Captain Thorpe" gender="M" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Thorpe_18">Don't you see? It was her soul all along!</string>

	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_02" speaker="The Tempest" gender="F" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_02">Fortunately, I have minions to deal with whatever flotsam washes in.</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_03" speaker="The Tempest" gender="F" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_03">You will give in to Corruption, or you will be destroyed.”</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_04" speaker="The Tempest" gender="F" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_04"> Target practice before my ships set sail to corrupt the world.</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_05" speaker="The Tempest" gender="F" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_05">You don't deserve the honor of dying at my hand.</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_06" speaker="The Tempest" gender="F" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_06">I keep them hungry for just such an occasion.</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_07" speaker="The Tempest" gender="F" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_07">Behold the true face of Corruption.</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_08" speaker="The Tempest" gender="F" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_08">Hell hath no fury like me!</string>

	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_12" speaker="The Tempest" gender="F" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_12">The Tempest will swallow you whole.</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_13" speaker="The Tempest" gender="F" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_13">Meet my slaves. Soon, you will be one of them.</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_14" speaker="The Tempest" gender="F" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_14">I have great plans for you.</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_15" speaker="The Tempest" gender="F" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_15">I will make an example of you.</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_16" speaker="The Tempest" gender="F" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_16">Ah. One last obstacle.</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_17" speaker="The Tempest" gender="F" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_17">Have you come to worship me? It won't save you.</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_18" speaker="The Tempest" gender="F" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_18">Welcome to the new world order.</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_19" speaker="The Tempest" gender="F" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_19">Hilarious. Like cockroaches storming the gates.</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_20" speaker="The Tempest" gender="F" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_20">I am Isabella. You'll find I am nothing like that fool, Thorpe.</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_21" speaker="The Tempest" gender="F" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_21">I take what I want, and I want everything.</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_22" speaker="The Tempest" gender="F" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_22"> You will make an excellent target.</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_23" speaker="The Tempest" gender="F" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_23">Whoever kills them will be rewarded.</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_24" speaker="The Tempest" gender="F" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_24">This should be amusing.</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_25" speaker="The Tempest" gender="F" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_25">Dance for me.</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_26" speaker="The Tempest" gender="F" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_26">You deserve a truly pathetic death.</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_27" speaker="The Tempest" gender="F" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_27">It seems you long for death. Such a waste.</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_28" speaker="The Tempest" gender="F" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_28">Hah. Struggle all you want.</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_29" speaker="The Tempest" gender="F" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_29">Let's not waste my time.</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_30" speaker="The Tempest" gender="F" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_30">Do you like my pets? Would you like to be one of them?</string>
	<string key="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_31" speaker="The Tempest" gender="F" VO="97_CombatTaunt_Isabella_31">No...I can't die...</string>
