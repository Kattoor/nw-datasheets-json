	<string key="0233_Hunter_DefeaultDialogue_03" comment="Final" speaker="Holt Hutchison - Brightwood" name="HoltHutchison" VO_Status="Needs Recording">Still working up the nerve. This is harder than I thought.\n\nIt's funny, those bears are the only family I've ever known - not sure if I'll ever feel completely comfortable with them, though.</string>

And now, even those are starting to fade.</string>

These keepsakes you recovered for me, they were supposed to make me sad.\n\nAt this point, I've run out of hope, and frankly, I'd rather just be done with it.</string>

You see, when the truth came out, everyone in town turned on me.</string>
	<string key="0234_Mourner_DeafultDialogue_04" comment="Final" speaker="Megara Pantazis - Brightwood" name="MegaraPantazis" VO_Status="Needs Recording">It just goes to show, life is only for those bold and courageous enough to truly live it.\n\nPastor Walsham was always so damn conflicted. I think maybe now, I can start over.</string>
